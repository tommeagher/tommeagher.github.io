After years of hearing about it and after months of hearing friends and loved ones raving about it, I've decided to take the plunge and explore [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/).

In years past, I had flirted with [Friendster](http://www.friendster.com/) and [Myspace](http://www.myspace.com) with varying degrees of interest. But Facebook seems to be the juggernaut that is outpacing all its competitors. So I've begun to set up a profile and nose around it. Here's my question for you, my small cadre of readers: Once you're signed up on Facebook, what do you do with it?

I mean, there are only so many long-lost college classmates to track down. And once we ascertain that we both exist in cyberspace and exchange some pleasantries, then what? What's your favorite thing about Facebook?

And once you've built your social network, what do you think is the best use for it?

I'd love to hear your thoughts and advice.
