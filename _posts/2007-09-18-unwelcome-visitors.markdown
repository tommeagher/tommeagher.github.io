In this era of [spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)) and [astroturf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing), not all readers of the blog are the same. I had a new user visit and register recently, but [apparently I'm not the only site he visited](http://cubelodyte.com/2007/09/17/nice-try/).

I guess I should be flattered, but no readers are sometimes better than a flood of spam.
