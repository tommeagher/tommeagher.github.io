The nature of the news business, and the 24/7 demand of following [the world of futbol](http://njmg.typepad.com/fixture/), keeps me more than busy much of the time. Thus, this little professional blog ends up taking a back seat until the spirit moves me.

I know it's been awhile, and summer has already sprinted past us, but here's a quick update. Now that school's back in session, I have one more responsibility to add to my plate. This semester, I'm the North Jersey Media Group fellow at [Fairleigh Dickinson University](http://www.fdu.edu/). As part of the fellowship, I'm teaching an introductory course in CAR for students at the campus that straddles [the lazy Hackensack River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackensack_River).

The semester has barely begun, but so far I'm enjoying working with my tiny class. The students seem curious and eager to learn about working with Excel and databases, even if it's not quite clear to them yet what to do with it all. I think this will be a good chance for me to practice my classroom demeanor. And hopefully it'll give me the impetus to make some more headway on fleshing out the Best Practices section.

What advice do you have for me as I strive to teach the next generation of journalists and writers?
