Some people spend years trying to learn our craft, spending thousands on graduate schools. Others just go where the news is, roll up their sleeves and give it a shot.

I can't say that my friend David Lang's method is the best way to get into the business, but it's not the craziest either. [David](http://davidlang.blogspot.com/) is an accomplished photographer who has been learning the craft of making pictures for some time, but this winter he went out on a limb. He flew to Pakistan for a month to cover the presidential elections there and to explore Afghanistan.

So now, camera and lights in hand, David is having a hell of an adventure, and he's no longer just a documentary photographer. He's a journalist. [His blog](http://davidlang.blogspot.com/) about his experiences in the 'stans is funny, engaging and definitely worth a read. I have a feeling we'll all be seeing much more of[ his work ](http://www.davidlang.com/main.php)soon.
