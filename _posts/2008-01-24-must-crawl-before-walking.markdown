I've been putting off posting here for weeks, hoping inspiration would strike, or I would suddenly find a bounty of free time to think of something really insightful.

None of this happened, so I'll drop a few tidbits of news and links to some friends, and hope I can get things rolling here again shortly.

First, I'm no longer [my paper's](http://www.myheraldnews.com/) CAR reporter. Last month, I was promoted to city editor. I can just hear you, in your best [Maude Lebowski tone](http://www.gotwavs.com/php/sounds/?id=gog&media=WAVS&type=Movies&movie=Big_Lebowski&quote=achievers.txt&file=achievers.wav), saying to yourself "And proud we are of you...". Yes, it's a nice new job to throw me back at the bottom of a steep learning curve. Thankfully, some friends have been giving me [some advice](http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080108/a-crowdsourcing-experiment/).

So for the time being, let me just say I promise to post again soon. There's loads of cool and exciting things happening on the Web that should make journalists [informed](http://www.wiredjournalists.com) and [nervous ](http://www.everyblock.com)(in a good way, like a roller-coaster ride). They should keep you busy for a bit.

 And let me pass on a couple of old nuggets from a former editor: [get out of the newsroom](http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20071214/agoraphobics-in-your-newsroom/), and use your e-mail addressbook as [a way to cultivate sources](http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080113/newsletters-your-secret-to-developing-sources/).

So stop obsessing over this season of "The Wire" and step up your game, people. I'm trying to.

Cheers.
