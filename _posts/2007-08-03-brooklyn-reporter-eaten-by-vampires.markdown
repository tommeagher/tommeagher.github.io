I can think of no better way to launch this new experiment in blogging than to sadly note the passing of an icon of American journalism. As it was [reported earlier this week](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/business/media/30weekly.html), the venerable [Weekly World News](http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/) will soon go dark. This fine purveyor of insane fictional columnists and alien abductions has entertained shoppers at grocery stores nationwide for decades. The progenitor of [The Onion](http://www.theonion.com), [The Colbert Report](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/most_recent/index.jhtml) and [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com), it developed a devoted cult following. It died at 28.

On that note, I'll briefly introduce this site. I hope it will serve as a platform for me to share some of my experiences and work as a newspaper journalist in [computer-assisted](http://www.nicar.org/) and [investigative reporting](http://www.ire.org/). I also plan to share techniques and Web resources that I find useful in my daily reporting. It will pay for you to keep an eye on the "Cool Resources" and "[Reporting & CAR](http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/17713610159695614602/label/reporting-blog)" feeds on the right column.

In my spare moments, I hope to be able to comment on one of my other passions: [soccer](http://www.mlsnet.com/). Let's see where this all leads us. Thanks for tuning in.

Cheers.
