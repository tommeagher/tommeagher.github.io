A friend just alerted me to [Kirix Strata](http://www.kirix.com/), a Web browser that will let you work with raw data as you see it on your favorite Web pages. You can easily manipulate html tables or create mash-ups with RSS feeds. This is an intriguing idea. I wonder if, like [Swivel](http://blog.swivel.com/) (another new-fangled Internet contraption I haven't had the time to really explore yet), this will help democratize data analysis.

(Of course, [Depth Reporting](http://www.depthreporting.com/2007/08/web-data-browser.html) had this tidbit more than a month ago, but I must have missed that post the first time around.)

These discoveries led me to a few questions:
	
  * Have any of you had a chance to use either Kirix Strata or Swivel?
  * What have you been able to do with these tools and would you recommend them for a harried journalist working with data?
  * What pointers can you share to help a newbie get the most out of these applications?

I'd love to hear any feedback you have. Post a comment and let me know what you think.
