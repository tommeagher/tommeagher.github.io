<p>A friend just alerted me to <a href="http://www.kirix.com/">Kirix Strata</a>, a Web browser that will let you work with raw data as you see it on your favorite Web pages. You can easily manipulate html tables or create mash-ups with RSS feeds. This is an intriguing idea. I wonder if, like <a href="http://blog.swivel.com/">Swivel</a> (another new-fangled Internet contraption I haven’t had the time to really explore yet), this will help democratize data analysis.</p>

<p>(Of course, <a href="http://www.depthreporting.com/2007/08/web-data-browser.html">Depth Reporting</a> had this tidbit more than a month ago, but I must have missed that post the first time around.)</p>

<p>These discoveries led me to a few questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have any of you had a chance to use either Kirix Strata or Swivel?</li>
  <li>What have you been able to do with these tools and would you recommend them for a harried journalist working with data?</li>
  <li>What pointers can you share to help a newbie get the most out of these applications?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d love to hear any feedback you have. Post a comment and let me know what you think.</p>
