<p>On Tuesday, we lost <a href="http://www.myheraldnews.com/view.html?type=stories&amp;action=detail&amp;sub_id=27821">a colleague and an accomplished journalist</a> when Jonathan Maslow died.</p>

<p>Plenty of <a href="http://www.theenergyindependent.com/jonathan-evan-maslow/jonathan-evan-maslow-1948-2008.html">others</a> have <a href="http://www.capemaycountyherald.com/article/21803-former-herald-reporter-jonathan-e-maslow-59">already</a> shared their memories and their sadness <a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080220/journalism-mourns-a-loss/">much better</a> than I can. All I’ll say is that his humor and his passion for life and the newsman’s craft will be sorely missed in this newsroom. And those traits are desperately needed in so many others.</p>
