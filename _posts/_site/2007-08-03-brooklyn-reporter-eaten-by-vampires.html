<p>I can think of no better way to launch this new experiment in blogging than to sadly note the passing of an icon of American journalism. As it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/business/media/30weekly.html">reported earlier this week</a>, the venerable <a href="http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/">Weekly World News</a> will soon go dark. This fine purveyor of insane fictional columnists and alien abductions has entertained shoppers at grocery stores nationwide for decades. The progenitor of <a href="http://www.theonion.com">The Onion</a>, <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/most_recent/index.jhtml">The Colbert Report</a> and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com">Fox News</a>, it developed a devoted cult following. It died at 28.</p>

<p>On that note, I’ll briefly introduce this site. I hope it will serve as a platform for me to share some of my experiences and work as a newspaper journalist in <a href="http://www.nicar.org/">computer-assisted</a> and <a href="http://www.ire.org/">investigative reporting</a>. I also plan to share techniques and Web resources that I find useful in my daily reporting. It will pay for you to keep an eye on the “Cool Resources” and “<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/17713610159695614602/label/reporting-blog">Reporting &amp; CAR</a>” feeds on the right column.</p>

<p>In my spare moments, I hope to be able to comment on one of my other passions: <a href="http://www.mlsnet.com/">soccer</a>. Let’s see where this all leads us. Thanks for tuning in.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
