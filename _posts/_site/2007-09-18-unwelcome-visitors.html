<p>In this era of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)">spam</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturf</a>, not all readers of the blog are the same. I had a new user visit and register recently, but <a href="http://cubelodyte.com/2007/09/17/nice-try/">apparently Iâ€™m not the only site he visited</a>.</p>

<p>I guess I should be flattered, but no readers are sometimes better than a flood of spam.</p>
