<p>In our rush to embrace the Web, it’s interesting to keep in mind some of the limitations the medium could impose on journalists.</p>

<p>CNet News.com posted a story looking at how some of <a href="http://news.com.com/Newspaper+headlines+lost+in+Web+translation/2100-1025_3-6155618.html">history’s best headlines</a> might not hack it in the digital age. Here’s what they write about one of my favorites…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<strong>Ford to city: Drop dead</strong>” – New York Daily News reporting President Ford’s denial of a federal bailout (1975)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Internet search expert]: Would suggest “President Ford” over “Ford”, and “New York City” over “City”.</p>
