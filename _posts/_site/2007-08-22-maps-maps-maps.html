<p>It seems the Internet has done as much for amateur cartographers as it has for budding pornographers.</p>

<p>As <a href="/blog/2007/08/the-truth-in-numbers.html">I promised earlier</a>, I have a few resources to share on mapping, particularly of the Google Maps variety. I had actually been planning on posting this for the last few days, when I noticed <a href="http://analyticjournalism.blogharbor.com/blog/_archives/2007/8/15/3160819.html">this mention the Analytic Journalism blog</a> of Google’s new feature that allows users to embed a personal Google Map into a Web blog using just a tiny snippet of HTML. This is a feature that’s long overdue, and should make all of the hub-bub over <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/tag/mapping">map mash-ups</a> all the more accessible for the average user.</p>

<p>I almost wish they had offered such a feature last year when I made <a href="http://northjersey.com/static/maps/paterson_map_101506.html">my first Google Map</a>. I was writing an investigative project about the city of Paterson selling off its property tax liens against vacant lots to a third-party investor. I decided to take the database I had already built, and with a little help from Excel, I was able to add the lines of code that let me dump it into a map using the <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/">Google Maps API</a>. Without ever having worked with an API in my life–just a little bit of rudimentary HTML–I was able to learn the code and whip up the map in the span of a couple days. Most of that time was spent on the hardest part: driving around town with a laptop on my passenger’s seat and a photographer in the back taking pictures of each of the 160+ properties on the map. I thought it came out great.</p>

<p>Adding a Google Map to your story (or a Yahoo Map for that matter) is considerably easier than working with ArcGIS to produce the static maps you often see in the paper. And its a great Web feature that readers seem to dig. If you want to learn how to start tinkering with the API, here’s a few good starter pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.econym.demon.co.uk/googlemaps/">Google Maps API tutorial</a>	</li>
  <li><a href="http://mapki.com/wiki/Main_Page">Mapki: a Google Maps wiki</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/">Google Maps Mania</a> blog</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.wotton.org/map/batchgeo.html">Google Maps geocoder</a> (which you need to determine the longitude and latitude points for the addresses you want to plot on a map.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://mapmaker.donkeymagic.co.uk/">Donkey Magic mapmaker</a> will help you create your map using next to no code. It writes the backend source code and you just cut and paste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, here’s a few other of my favorite recent mapping toys:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/">Gmap Pedometer</a> helps you find routes (and distances between destinations) as the crow walks, block by block.  This is great for living in New York City. I use it to plot out <a href="http://del.icio.us/tommeagher/biking">my weekly bike rides</a> across the Outer Boroughs.	</li>
  <li>Finally, <a href="http://www.batchgeocode.com/">BatchGeocode.com</a> is a great resource that I seem to use again and again for mapping projects large and small. If you have a lot of points (more than a few hundred), it can take some time, but it’s free and it’s easy, like all good maps (and graphics in general) should be.</li>
</ul>
