<p>There’s been a lot of hand-wringing in recent years about the bleak future of journalism in general and of newspapers in particular.</p>

<p>There are two skills that I believe are now indispensable in the field. Any journalist who won’t begin to embrace them is simply not ready for the future of the business. What are they? Computer-assisted reporting and Spanish (or any other second language, for that matter).</p>

<p>Very few news organizations or journalism programs have invested resources into teaching their journalists these skills. How are you supposed to learn them, then? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">DIY</a>!</p>

<p>Not everyone has the time or money to attend one of <a href="http://www.ire.org/training/otr.php">IRE’s excellent training sessions</a>. Thankfully people like my colleague Christopher Schnaars at <a href="http://www.northjersey.com">The Record</a> have pulled together some resources for you to learn on your own (<em>stage whisper: thanks to <a href="http://www.depthreporting.com/2007/10/free-excel-training-course-at-reporters.html">Depth Reporting</a> for pointing this out</em>).  Schnaars has a great, <a href="http://www.forjournalists.com/cookbook/media/ExcelTraining.zip">four-part course</a> on learning to use the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program. This is not <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4sOFVAR87I">C++ GUI programming</a>. These are basic skills that every reporter in the newsroom can and should master. Do yourself a favor and work through Schnaar’s lessons. You’ll find them endlessly helpful in your reporting and editing. If you want to keep going after that, then the <a href="http://forjournalists.com/cookbook/index.php?title=Main_Page">Reporter’s Cookbook</a> will point you to the help you need.</p>

<p>Personally, I’ve got the CAR skills, and now I’m turning my attention to learning a new language. Thank you, <a href="http://www.clifton.k12.nj.us/adulteducation.asp">Clifton High School’s adult education night classes</a>. You should look at night schools and community colleges in your area for similarly-affordable options. I’m about a third of the way through an elementary Spanish class. To gauge my progress, you can see this short exchange I wrote myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“¿Como esta?”
“No rapido, pero de acuerda.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If my very, very rudimentary Spanish is off the mark, which it likely is, allow me to translate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How is it?” (meaning my progress in learning Spanish)
“Not fast, but OK.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve got to learn to walk before you can run. Good luck.</p>
