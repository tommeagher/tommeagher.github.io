<p>From time to time, you read about journalists being imprisoned in far-off countries for doing their jobs. Only rarely do you recognize their names.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Barry Bearak of the New York Times was arrested in Zimbabwe and accused of  “<a href="http://http://www.cpj.org/news/2008/africa/zim04apr08na2.html">practicing journalism without accreditation</a>”. I made Bearak’s acquaintance a few years ago when he was teaching at Columbia University’s journalism school. I’ve since become a fan of his work. He’s a gifted and probing writer who has won the Pulitzer Prize, the highest honor in American journalism.</p>

<p>I heard about Bearak’s arrest this morning on the BBC. I can’t profess to know all the ins and outs of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/world/africa/04zimbabwe.html?_r=1&amp;st=cse&amp;sq=bearak&amp;scp=1&amp;oref=slogin">situation in Zimbabwe</a>, but I know that Bearak is a journalist of integrity. I hope that Barry is safe and sound and released quickly.</p>

<p>It’s an outrage that any government would jail a journalist for doing his job. A lot of people like to grouse about the American news media and accuse it of rampant bias. But situations like these only reinforce how vital an unfettered press is to a true democracy.</p>

<p>**Update: **<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/world/africa/08bearak.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=bearak&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin">Bearak was freed on bail Monday</a>. Hopefully, his case will help shine a light on the persecution of journalists and restrictions on the free flow of information in Zimbabwe. Maybe that light can help the people there make a change.</p>
