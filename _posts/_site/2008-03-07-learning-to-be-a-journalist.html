<p>Some people spend years trying to learn our craft, spending thousands on graduate schools. Others just go where the news is, roll up their sleeves and give it a shot.</p>

<p>I can’t say that my friend David Lang’s method is the best way to get into the business, but it’s not the craziest either. <a href="http://davidlang.blogspot.com/">David</a> is an accomplished photographer who has been learning the craft of making pictures for some time, but this winter he went out on a limb. He flew to Pakistan for a month to cover the presidential elections there and to explore Afghanistan.</p>

<p>So now, camera and lights in hand, David is having a hell of an adventure, and he’s no longer just a documentary photographer. He’s a journalist. <a href="http://davidlang.blogspot.com/">His blog</a> about his experiences in the ‘stans is funny, engaging and definitely worth a read. I have a feeling we’ll all be seeing much more of<a href="http://www.davidlang.com/main.php"> his work </a>soon.</p>
