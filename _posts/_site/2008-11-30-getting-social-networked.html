<p>After years of hearing about it and after months of hearing friends and loved ones raving about it, I’ve decided to take the plunge and explore <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>In years past, I had flirted with <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com">Myspace</a> with varying degrees of interest. But Facebook seems to be the juggernaut that is outpacing all its competitors. So I’ve begun to set up a profile and nose around it. Here’s my question for you, my small cadre of readers: Once you’re signed up on Facebook, what do you do with it?</p>

<p>I mean, there are only so many long-lost college classmates to track down. And once we ascertain that we both exist in cyberspace and exchange some pleasantries, then what? What’s your favorite thing about Facebook?</p>

<p>And once you’ve built your social network, what do you think is the best use for it?</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice.</p>
