<p>I’ve been putting off posting here for weeks, hoping inspiration would strike, or I would suddenly find a bounty of free time to think of something really insightful.</p>

<p>None of this happened, so I’ll drop a few tidbits of news and links to some friends, and hope I can get things rolling here again shortly.</p>

<p>First, I’m no longer <a href="http://www.myheraldnews.com/">my paper’s</a> CAR reporter. Last month, I was promoted to city editor. I can just hear you, in your best <a href="http://www.gotwavs.com/php/sounds/?id=gog&amp;media=WAVS&amp;type=Movies&amp;movie=Big_Lebowski&amp;quote=achievers.txt&amp;file=achievers.wav">Maude Lebowski tone</a>, saying to yourself “And proud we are of you…”. Yes, it’s a nice new job to throw me back at the bottom of a steep learning curve. Thankfully, some friends have been giving me <a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080108/a-crowdsourcing-experiment/">some advice</a>.</p>

<p>So for the time being, let me just say I promise to post again soon. There’s loads of cool and exciting things happening on the Web that should make journalists <a href="http://www.wiredjournalists.com">informed</a> and <a href="http://www.everyblock.com">nervous </a>(in a good way, like a roller-coaster ride). They should keep you busy for a bit.</p>

<p> And let me pass on a couple of old nuggets from a former editor: <a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20071214/agoraphobics-in-your-newsroom/">get out of the newsroom</a>, and use your e-mail addressbook as <a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080113/newsletters-your-secret-to-developing-sources/">a way to cultivate sources</a>.</p>

<p>So stop obsessing over this season of “The Wire” and step up your game, people. I’m trying to.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
