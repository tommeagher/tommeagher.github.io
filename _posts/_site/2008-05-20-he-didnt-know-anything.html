<p>I read a lot of nonfiction, <a href="http://brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book_id/970">literary</a> and <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/10/03/woodward/index_np.html">otherwise</a>, and I recently finished one of the better books I’ve found on American culture and media in the middle of the 20th Century. “<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7096480">The Race Beat</a>” not only chronicles the coverage of the civil rights movement and its effects on American society, it offers a few good lessons on being a journalist.</p>

<p>Here’s my favorite:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One other thing made <a href="http://www.pbs.org/weta/reportingamericaatwar/reporters/bigart/">Bigart</a> memorable: he spoke with a stammer that colleagues frequently saw him use to his benefit to coax information from reluctant sources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/11547/index1.html">Lelyveld</a>, sent to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Civil_Rights_Workers_Murders">Philadelphia</a> after Bigart, met a local minister, introduced himself, and interviewed the minister. He came away with an unforgettable lesson in what it takes to be a great newspaper reporter.</p>

<p>“‘You’ve asked me a lot of questions,’ the minister said in a buttery southern accent after the interview was over. ‘Can I ask you one?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes sir’, Lelyveld responded.</p>

<p>“‘There was a man down here, an older man, said <em>he</em> was from <a href="http://www.southerner.net/v1n3_99/gaytalese.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Name of Bigaht. Know ‘im?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Couldn’t have a normal conversation with that man,’ the minister went on. ‘He didn’t know anything. I had to explain <strong><em>evvvverything</em></strong> to him.’”</p>

<p>Not a bad M.O. if you can pull it off. We can all learn from the old masters.</p>
