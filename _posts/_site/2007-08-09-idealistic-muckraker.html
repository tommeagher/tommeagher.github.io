<p>From my old Web site’s bio:</p>

<p>There are times when I wonder what I’ve gotten into by becoming a journalist.</p>

<p>When I spent 11 hours a day working as a laborer <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/temporarylife">for a story</a> only to go to my temporary home with its shabby little bed in a rooming house, I pondered whether my reporting would make a difference.</p>

<p>On another story, I trudged bootless through knee-deep flood waters in a ramshackle and neglected neighborhood along the Passaic River in Paterson, New Jersey. I thought that people might not be able to comprehend the suffering of the poor that natural disasters could only compound.</p>

<p>And when, on assignment, I choked on pepper spray as I stood among protesters being arrested, taking notes at a presidential inauguration, I worried that I wouldn’t be able to breathe again.</p>

<p>But each of these times, and every day before and since, I reminded myself that if I do not write these stories, no one else will. My job is to shine a light on the lives of working Americans. Without these stories, our understanding of modern life is not only incomplete, it’s inaccurate.</p>

<p>The quest to tell these stories began for me at 18, when I moved from my hometown of Baltimore to the Midwest. I began to dive into the lives of the working-class and the forgotten Americans that I would <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/temporarylife">later chronicle in my work</a>. Even while I studied at, and eventually was graduated from, the world’s first journalism school at the <a href="http://www.journalism.missouri.edu">University of Missouri</a>, I longed to write their stories.</p>

<p>Since then, I have worked for several newspapers and a wire service. But I also worked in a hodgepodge of fields that have reminded me of the greater world, a world outside the halls of government and police stations where we as journalists often find ourselves stuck. I have been a welder, a construction laborer, a deli worker, a short-order cook, a DJ, a dishwasher, a record store clerk, a grocery store bagger and a closed-captioner.</p>

<p>Along the way, I moved to New York City where I completed my Master’s degree at the <a href="http://www.jrn.columbia.edu">Graduate School of Journalism</a> at Columbia University.</p>

<p>Today, I live in Brooklyn with my wife, her very fat cat and our very old dog. I am the research reporter–responsible for computer-assisted reporting and freedom of information requests–for the daily <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/">Herald News</a>, about 20 miles away in New Jersey. My job allows me to pursue the kind of journalism I’ve always wanted to do. I get to write stories–about corruption, about poverty, about working, about floods and protests–that people need to read. I get to write stories that show our readers a world they never knew existed or, worse yet, never understood.</p>

<p>In what little free time I have, I am also researching a book that I began while a student in Samuel Freedman’s renowned <a href="http://www.samuelfreedman.com/seminar.html">book-writing seminar</a>.</p>

<p>I’m very glad you stumbled upon this Web site. I hope you’re looking for the kind of stories that I like to write, stories about people who never get recognized. Now you’ll know to watch for my byline. You’ll be reading a lot more of my work.</p>
