In our rush to embrace the Web, it's interesting to keep in mind some of the limitations the medium could impose on journalists.

CNet News.com posted a story looking at how some of [history's best headlines](http://news.com.com/Newspaper+headlines+lost+in+Web+translation/2100-1025_3-6155618.html) might not hack it in the digital age. Here's what they write about one of my favorites...

[Internet search expert]: Would suggest "President Ford" over "Ford", and "New York City" over "City".
