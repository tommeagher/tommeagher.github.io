I read a lot of nonfiction, [literary](http://brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book_id/970) and [otherwise](http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/10/03/woodward/index_np.html), and I recently finished one of the better books I've found on American culture and media in the middle of the 20th Century. "[The Race Beat](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7096480)" not only chronicles the coverage of the civil rights movement and its effects on American society, it offers a few good lessons on being a journalist.

Here's my favorite:


> "One other thing made [Bigart](http://www.pbs.org/weta/reportingamericaatwar/reporters/bigart/) memorable: he spoke with a stammer that colleagues frequently saw him use to his benefit to coax information from reluctant sources.

[Lelyveld](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/11547/index1.html), sent to [Philadelphia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Civil_Rights_Workers_Murders) after Bigart, met a local minister, introduced himself, and interviewed the minister. He came away with an unforgettable lesson in what it takes to be a great newspaper reporter.

"'You've asked me a lot of questions,' the minister said in a buttery southern accent after the interview was over. 'Can I ask you one?'

"'Yes sir', Lelyveld responded.

"'There was a man down here, an older man, said _he_ was from [_The New York Times_](http://www.southerner.net/v1n3_99/gaytalese.html). Name of Bigaht. Know 'im?'

"'Yes sir.'

"'Couldn't have a normal conversation with that man,' the minister went on. 'He didn't know anything. I had to explain **_evvvverything_** to him.'"


Not a bad M.O. if you can pull it off. We can all learn from the old masters.
