            <p>It all started in September, at the <a href="http://ona12.journalists.org/">Online News Association</a>&#8216;s
conference in San Francisco. I crashed the [#wjchat][] party and ended
up meeting the infamous <a href="http://www.debragalant.com/">Debbie Galant</a>, the force of nature behind
<a href="http://www.baristanet.com/">Baristanet</a> who was just starting the <a href="http://njnewscommons.org/"><span class="caps">NJ</span> News Commons</a>. We talked
about journalism in Jersey. I floated the idea of a news hackathon, and
she was&nbsp;intrigued.</p>
<p>Fast forward through a hurricane, an election, months of planning and
promotion, and <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/03/11/rounding-up-our-hack-weekend/">24 hours of hacking</a>. I sat in a lecture hall at
Montclair State University listening in awe to 11 teams of journalists
and programmers pitch their projects to change news in New&nbsp;Jersey.</p>
<p>[Of course, I&#8217;m glossing over many logistical details here. I&#8217;ll just
say that we could not have pulled it off without the generosity and
advice of our <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/sponsors-2/">sponsors and partners</a>, especially the News Commons and
<a href="http://www.montclair.edu/arts/school-of-communication-and-media/">the university</a>, <a href="http://www.mozillaopennews.org/">Knight-Mozilla OpenNews</a>, <a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a>,
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/">O&#8217;Reilly</a>, <a href="http://www.nj.com/">The Star-Ledger</a>, <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/">The Record</a>, <a href="http://www.patch.com/">Patch</a>, <a href="http://echolocation.com/">Echo</a>
and many&nbsp;others.]</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe we pulled it off. There&#8217;s no way I could have
imagined in September how much I&#8217;d learn about building community,
blending cultures and sowing the seeds for us to think about news and
data in new ways. Among those&nbsp;lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a serious miscalculation on my part to try to start at 9 a.m.
    on a Saturday. Neither journalists nor developers are early risers.
    As we waited for folks to drift in, we had to start late and rush
    some of <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/03/11/rounding-up-our-hack-weekend/">the presentations</a>.</li>
<li>One of the biggest challenges was trying to manage people&#8217;s
    expectations of what they&#8217;d get out of giving up a weekend to stare
    at a computer screen on a college campus. Some people wanted to
    learn to code. Others wanted nerds to help them with their next big
    project. A few, I imagine, wanted to network for a job. We wanted
    everyone to feel like she or he could be a part of this experience
    and could offer something, no matter previous experience or skill
    level. For some newsroom denizens whose only exposure to developers
    was their much maligned <span class="caps">IT</span> staff, this was a revolutionary idea.
    They have been trained to treat technologists like a deli counter:
    Order up whatever newfangled internet thing you need and wait for it
    to show up. My hope was at the end of the hackathon, our reporters
    and developers could start to imagine how they can work together. I
    think on that front we&nbsp;succeeded.</li>
<li>We may have overloaded the schedule with speakers, and our talks
    were geared too heavily toward journalists. Some of the participants
    would have liked more discussion of the process of creating news
    apps rather than the concepts of data journalism and news app
    thinking. Others wanted less yakking and more&nbsp;hacking.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s just as important for us to bring programmers to the news world
    as it is to introduce journalists to the development process. We
    succeeded on the latter, but we need to do more for the former. We
    could have used speakers from the tech world who would have lured
    more&nbsp;programmers.</li>
<li>I wish we had more diversity in <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/speakers/">our roster of speakers</a>. I was
    thrilled to have Emily Bell as <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/judges/">one of our judges</a>.Â A majority of
    the folks on our planning committee were women, as were many of our
    participants. But I think we erred in not having more women
    presenters, giving a false impression of the state of news
    development and the programming world as a&nbsp;whole.</li>
<li>We just didn&#8217;t have enough developers. We needed to have more than
    one on each team, preferably someone with backend skills and someone
    else with frontend skills. Some of the teams had one developer and
    four journalists. That just didn&#8217;t&nbsp;work.</li>
<li>We found some teams didn&#8217;t need more than one or two journalists,
    even those with significant computer-assisted reporting skills. Some
    of the <span class="caps">CAR</span> veterans had a hard time translating their expertise in
    analyzing data to the idea of developing a reusable&nbsp;application.</li>
<li>To my surprise, many of the programmers were not really familiar
    <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/2013/03/learning-to-commit-to-version-control/">with version control or git</a>. Only Sunday morning, as the
    deadline loomed, did some teams ask about how to use Github, leaving
    me to run around and teach people. Some teams also didn&#8217;t have
    server space to host a demo site, something I assumed was a given. A
    suggestion from judge and mentor Jonathan Soo was to have us offer
    hosted server space for the teams and to require everyone to push an
    initial commit to Github within the first hour of&nbsp;hacking.</li>
<li>The teams with strong projects at the end either came with an idea
    or settled on one very quickly. We need a mechanism for teams to
    find members and for people to think about data and project ideas
    ahead of time. Some teams spent far too much time arguing over ideas
    or failed to really evaluate the data they were hoping to use.
    Suggestions were made for a pre-networking event a week before or a
    forum or email list for people to talk ahead of&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>I realized far too late that <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/">our website</a> was good for displaying
    details on the event planning, but <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/blog-2/">the blog</a> was completely
    unusable. The commenting system didn&#8217;t work at all. Next time, we
    need to test that earlier or set up a functional blog at&nbsp;blog.hackjersey.com.</li>
<li>Of <a href="https://github.com/hackjersey">our 11 projects</a>, three teams didn&#8217;t finish enough to present
    anything beyond what they learned from not finishing. Another four
    teams had very rough demos, but had proofs of concept to show. So
    <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/01/28/and-the-winners-are/">four teams finished</a> pretty much functional&nbsp;projects.</li>
<li>If you want to build a strong community, the best way to start is by
    recruiting a broad coalition of journalists, developers, designers,
    hackers, educators, nonprofits and bureaucrats to help plan the
    event. Thanks in large part to Debbie Galant, we had more than 20
    people on our organizing committee, and their ideas and dedication
    made this hackathon&nbsp;work.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I considered our first Hack Jersey event a success. And that
leads us to think about what&#8217;s next. We have a few&nbsp;ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ongoing sponsorship from the New Jersey News Commons and the
    School of Communication and Media at Montclair State&nbsp;University.</li>
<li>A hack day aimed at scraping a poorly structured public dataset that
    could be hosted for all to use&nbsp;freely.</li>
<li>Programming training, perhaps through a partnership with other
    groups who have already invented that&nbsp;wheel.</li>
<li>Basic data reporting training, which many working journalists say
    they are hungry&nbsp;for.</li>
<li>Solicit ideas for newsroom tools from news organizations large and
    small. Take that list of use cases and host a hack day or series of
    hack days to build open source&nbsp;tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/">Hack Jersey</a> should work on next? What
would be most useful to you as a journalist? If you&#8217;re a developer, what
kind of projects would you be interested in working on with us? I&#8217;d love
to hear your ideas. Please share them in the comments, or email us at&nbsp;hackinfo(at)hackjersey(dot)com.</p>
