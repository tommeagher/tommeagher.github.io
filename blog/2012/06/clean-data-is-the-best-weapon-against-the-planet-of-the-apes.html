You&#8217;re faced with a dilemma that&#8217;s fairly common in many&nbsp;newsrooms.</p>
<hr />
<p>Say, for example, a series of accidents kills a number of children
crossing busy streets near you. Now, you want to know the deadliest
roads or intersections in your area (this is not the dilemma, just wait
for it). <img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f0bvyZMrZ9k/TTjrIgdvMaI/AAAAAAAAGFE/UppLYR8YaJw/s1600/barney-fife.jpg" title="Barney Fife" /></p>
<div>
We always say in the news business to check it out, and we shouldn&#8217;t
trust anecdote and the frailty of human memory.  So where do you go?

</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<span>Does this guy, right, look like he has an encyclopedic knowledge
of every fatal accident in your five-county </span>coverage area?

</div>

<div>
File a public records request and get the data. It should have the
answer you need, right? You pick up your <span class="caps">CD</span> with the data, or if you&#8217;re
really lucky, the state police will have a file you can download from
their website. You expect to get a tidy Excel spreadsheet with very
orderly numbers on it. Everything will be geocoded, and you&#8217;ll just need
to do one quick pivot table or one quick group-by query and drop it into
[Fusion Tables][] and <span class="caps">BAM</span>! you&#8217;re done with your story. It writes
itself, right?

</div>

<p></div>
</div>

<p>You laugh, but this is what I spent years believing, and every time I
was&#8212;and continue to be&#8212;flabbergasted by the sloppiness of the public
data I get my hands&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>When I worked on the dangerous intersections story, I got something that
looked like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img alt="refine" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/refine.jpg" title="refine" /></p>
<div>
(This is a dramatization)

As David Donald said in his <span class="caps">CAR</span> panel yesterday, cleaning is the longest
and hardest part of the data process. Assume any data you get is dirty
and full of holes.

Government data is hardly unique in this respect, but it is our bread
and butter, and frankly we should expect better from the government, so
I&#8217;ll pick on it today.

</div>

<h2 id="wzxhzdk64why-is-so-much-public-data-such-a-messwzxhzdk65"><span>Why is so much public data such a&nbsp;mess?</span></h2>
<div>
​1. Much like journalists, government agencies are not nearly as good
with numbers as they ought to&nbsp;be.

</p>
<span>2. When databases exist, they are often built on things never
intended to be turned into relational data, like hand-written accident
reports.</span>

<p>
<span>3. Many agencies seem to subscribe to the[infinite monkey
theorem][].</span>

</div>

<div>
![][2]

</div>

<div>
<div>
For anyone unfamiliar with it, the infinite monkey theorem more or less
says that given an infinite amount of time and an infinite number of
monkeys with typewriters, eventually the monkeys will write the complete
works of Shakespeare or &#8220;A Tale of Two Cities.&#8221;

</div>

<div>
<div>
<span>When you work with a lot of public data, this is what feels like.
Occasionally there&#8217;s something correct, but before you find it, you have
to wade through what seems like a near-infinite number of errors.
</span><span><span> I&#8217;m not suggesting that government employees are
primates, but I am pretty certain that they&#8217;re outsourcing their data
entry to monkeys&#8230; and it gets worse.</span></span>

</div>

<div>
<span>  
</span>

</div>

<p></div>
</div>
<div>
<span>Because these monkeys are not&nbsp;geniuses.</span></p>
<p></div>
<img alt="" src="http://images.wikia.com/planetoftheapes/images/a/a3/Zaius_1.jpg" title="Dr. Zaius" /></p>
<div>
<div>
They are enemies of good data.

</div>

</div>

<div>
These monkeys are mean, and they hate puppies and clean data (and
water). To be fair, in my completely unscientific survey, the data has
gotten better in the past decade, but it&#8217;s not where it should be.

</div>

<div>
Every data entry mistake possible will be made. Often you fill find new
mistakes that you never, ever would have considered or imagined in your
wildest dreams.

</div>

<div>
<p>
<span>These clerical errors will make your life miserable. You can
either welcome our new monkey overlords or you can arm yourself.</span>

</div>

<h2 id="the-old-tools">The old&nbsp;tools</h2>
<div>
-   Excel: filters, pivot tables, string functions
-   Access: Group by queries
-   Notepad++: Regular expressions
-   Scripting language for automated, repetitive cleaning

</div>

<div>
With these, the cleaning of the database could take days or weeks or
longer.

</div>

<div>
Now you can do it with Google Refine in a few hours or less.

</div>

<div>
It can take that crap and turn it into a diamond.

</div>

<h2 id="what-is-refine-good-at">What is Refine good&nbsp;at?</h2>
<div>
- Transforming data, either on individual cells or whole columns at a
time

</div>

<div>
- Clustering data to find similar values that repeat for exploration and
cleaning

<p>
<span>- And many, many other tasks.</span>

</div>

<p>Refine does a lot of really amazing things, and this class will give you
just a tiny taste. It can help high-level programmers with repetitive
tasks, and it has its own expression language for accessing and
scrubbing data. But it is also a great tool for the less technical set.
If you&#8217;re comfortable with Microsoft Excel, you should be right at home
with Refine. You don&#8217;t have to be a comp sci PhD to love&nbsp;it.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
The two big areas we&#8217;re going to concentrate on today are clustering
data and transforming it

</div>

<p>So let&#8217;s get started. Here are instructions<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/InstallationInstructions">to install Refine</a> on your&nbsp;computer.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with a dataset of lottery winners from New Jersey. Say you
want to know what areas spend the most on lottery tickets but win the&nbsp;least.</p>
<p>Download <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lotterywinners.csv">the lottery dataset here</a>.</p>
<p>Refine runs through your web browser, but don&#8217;t worry, it works offline
as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>You can import a table file in many formats, either from your computer,
from Google Docs or from a <span class="caps">URL</span> for a file on the web. Once you have
Refine running, click &#8220;Create&nbsp;Project.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see a preview of what the data looks like. When you pull in the
<span class="caps">CSV</span> of lottery data, make sure to uncheck the &#8220;Parse cell data&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;option.</p>
<p><img alt="importcsv" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/importcsv.jpg" title="importcsv" /></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
New Jersey zip codes start with zero. If Refine guesses that column is a
number, it will drop the leading zero, so unchecking the option will
preserve the zips as text.

With this data, we&#8217;re going to use Refine to clean up the W\_TOWN column
to standardize the names of municipalities. But we never want to work
with the raw data, so let&#8217;s copy the column that we&#8217;ll actually
transform into something usable. So click on the arrow at the top of the
W\_TOWN column and choose the Edit Column\>Add column based on this
column option.

Enter a name for the new column. We&#8217;ll use &#8220;<span class="caps">TOWN</span>.&#8221; Original, I know.

</div>

<p><img alt="copycolumn" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/copycolumn.jpg" title="copycolumn" /></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Now, initially Refine will only display 10 rows, but there are 3,100 in
this dataset, so let&#8217;s look at a for more. Click the number 50 next to
&#8220;Show as&#8221; to see more.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
In Excel, one of the first things you&#8217;d do with a dataset is sort it. So
click on the arrow at the top of the <span class="caps">TOWN</span> column and choose &#8220;Sort&#8221; from
the options. Now,  you can filter out just a few records. Click on the
arrow and choose &#8220;Text Filter&#8221; from the options. You&#8217;ll see a box pop up
in the left column. Type in Atlantic and see how it plucks out only the
towns with &#8220;Atlantic&#8221; in the name: Atlantic City, Atlantic Highlands,
Atlantic High and West Atlantic City. As you might guess, not all of
these are real towns.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Let&#8217;s lose the filter. Click on the X in the upper left corner of the
filter box. Now, we&#8217;re going to add a Facet\> Text facet. Dan Nguyen
at ProPublica calls Refine&#8217;s faceting &#8220;the better way to filter.&#8221; He&#8217;s
totally right.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
The facet will create a box in the left column with the total number of
choices and a list of all the possible choices in this column and the
number of each. You&#8217;ll see there are 608 options. At the top is
&#8220;<span class="caps">ABERDEEN</span>&#8221; with 3 occurrences. Scroll to the bottom and click on &#8220;Facet
by choice counts.&#8221; This will create another box that will let you
display only the choices that occur a certain number of times. It shows
the range of values in a column and helps you to spot anomalies or
outliers. For instance, if you move the boundaries to only show the
choices with between 120 and 140 uses, you&#8217;ll only see &#8220;<span class="caps">JERSEY</span> <span class="caps">CITY</span>&#8221; and
&#8220;<span class="caps">NEWARK</span>&#8221; rows. Close the &#8220;Facet by choice counts&#8221; box.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Scroll through the text facet box a little ways into the Bs. See the
option for &#8220;<span class="caps">BELEE</span> <span class="caps">MEAD</span>&#8221;? It has one occurrence. Notice that two lines
later appears &#8220;<span class="caps">BELLE</span> <span class="caps">MEAD</span>,&#8221; the actual name of the town. If you hover
over &#8220;<span class="caps">BELEE</span> <span class="caps">MEAD</span>,&#8221; you will see the option to &#8220;edit&#8221; appear to the
right. Click on that and then fix the spelling of the name in the box
that appears. Notice that the choice count drops to 607.

</div>

<p><img alt="facet" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/facet.jpg" title="facet" /></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Let&#8217;s look at another way to clean data. Scroll down a few more lines.
Notice that there are two lines in a row for &#8220;<span class="caps">BERKELEY</span> <span class="caps">HEIGHTS</span>.&#8221; They&#8217;re
spelled the same, so why are they listed separately? Because one of them
has an extra space at the end of it that screws up the grouping. This is
the kind of thing that back in the bad old days would make you throw
your <span class="caps">PC</span> out the window two weeks into a data project. Instead, let&#8217;s get
rid of all the extra, invisible spaces. Click at the top of the <span class="caps">TOWN</span>
column, edit cells\> common transforms\> Trim leading and trailing
whitespace. Notice again how the choice count dropped. We&#8217;re down to 573
town names now. We&#8217;re getting there.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
So you could spend hours scrolling through and eyeballing similar names
and editing them by hand using these methods, or we could unleash the
real power of Refine: clustering.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Click on the &#8220;Cluster&#8221; button in the facet box. Click it and you&#8217;ll see
something like this. The default method is &#8220;key collision.&#8221; That should
only show a couple of options. Try changing it to &#8220;nearest neighbor.&#8221; I
can&#8217;t exactly explain the algorithm behind it, but it&#8217;s obvious that it
finds town names with similar names that should probably have the same
name. You see similar sets like &#8220;<span class="caps">POMPTON</span> <span class="caps">LAKES</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span class="caps">POMPTON</span> <span class="caps">LAKE</span>&#8221; or
&#8220;E. <span class="caps">ORANGE</span>,&#8221; &#8220;E <span class="caps">ORANGE</span>&#8221; and &#8220;E.<span class="caps">ORANGE</span>.&#8221; Click the &#8220;merge&#8221; button next to
each grouping and type the name you want them all to be changed to in
the &#8220;New Cell Value&#8221; column and hit the &#8220;Merge selected and recluster&#8221;
button at the bottom. You&#8217;ve just cleaned those messy columns to a
single value.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
![cluster][]

</div>

<p>Scroll through the list, reclustering and editing whole chunks at a
time. This is a huge time saver. When you&#8217;re done with the &#8220;nearest
neighbor&#8221; clusters, experiment with &#8220;key collision&#8221; and see if it picks
up any other similar&nbsp;names.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that to get this right, you&#8217;ll have to do some
additional reporting. You&#8217;ll need to be certain that &#8220;<span class="caps">NORTH</span> <span class="caps">BRUNSWICK</span>&#8221;
and &#8220;<span class="caps">NPRTH</span> <span class="caps">BRUNSWICK</span>&#8221; are indeed the same place and not separate values
as they came to you. If you&#8217;re confident in your reporting, Refine makes
the data cleaning&nbsp;easy.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re satisfied that you&#8217;re done, click on &#8220;Export&#8221; on the upper
right corner. You can output the file as html, <span class="caps">TSV</span>, <span class="caps">CSV</span>, Excel or any
number of formats. Pull it into your favorite spreadsheet program and
run your analysis. Then run it all again to make sure you got it right.
To be certain, start from scratch and triple-check&nbsp;it.</p>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left;">
As cool as this is, Refine has a few more tricks for the beginner. Let&#8217;s
look at this file of [<span class="caps">NJ</span> hospital report cards][].

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Create a new project and import it into Refine.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Anything look weird? How about that first column. Seems like it includes
information we&#8217;d probably want to split into several columns. In Excel
you&#8217;d do this with a series of nested functions. In Refine, we can do it
with a single click. At the top of the &#8220;Hospital&#8221; column, choose the
drop-down menu and Edit column\>Split into several columns&#8230;

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
When the wizard menu pops up, choose  a semicolon as the separator and
uncheck &#8220;remove this column,&#8221; because we always want to be compare
against our original data, right?

</div>

<p><img alt="splitcolumns" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/splitcolumns.jpg" title="splitcolumns" /></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
So this looks better, with the name, street, town, state and zip code in
separate columns. But something isn&#8217;t quite right. What about the zip
code? Why is it only four digits? Oh yeah, New Jersey zip codes start
with zeroes. Refine assumed that column was an integer and lopped off
the zero at the front.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Another great feature of Refine is that it logs everything you do with
the dataset. When you make a mistake or you want track back through your
work, click on the &#8220;Undo/Redo&#8221; tab at the top of the left column and you
can tiptoe back through your process.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Look at the list and click on the item at the top, &#8220;0. Create project&#8221;
to jump back to that step.

![undo][]

Now, redo the &#8220;Split into several columns&#8230;&#8221; step and this time uncheck
&#8220;Guess cell type&#8221; to preserve the zips as text.

Be sure to make note of the undo option at the top of the screen. You
can move a single step back at any time by clicking on this, much like
the undo prompt that appears in Gmail after you archive or delete a
message.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Finally, notice that the names of the hospital are inconsistent. Some
are all uppercase. Others are only upper-cased. Let&#8217;s standardize them.

Click on the arrow at the top of the Hospital column and choose Edit

<p>Voila. A cleaned dataset. You&#8217;re&nbsp;welcome.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let&#8217;s try one last dataset, this one looking at contributions from
<a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nassau_police_union_contribs.xls">Nassau County, <span class="caps">N.Y.</span> police unions</a> to political&nbsp;candidates.</p>
<p></p>
Import the data into Refine and let&#8217;s start by trying to clean up the
town&nbsp;names.</p>
<p>Add a text facet to the City column. Click Edit cells> Common
transforms> trim leading and trailing&nbsp;whitespace</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
See the count change from 240 to 238.

Now, let&#8217;s cluster the city names to see if we can consolidate any
entries.

</div>

<p><img alt="copcluster" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/copcluster.jpg" title="copcluster" /></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
How do you see the count change in the city column?

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Now, let&#8217;s turn our attention to the Name column. For this exercise,
let&#8217;s start by adding a filter on the city and just looking at &#8220;Albany.&#8221;
You can also do this by clicking on Albany in the text facet box.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Keep in mind  that any changes we make from here on out will only affect
the &#8220;Albany&#8221; subset of the data until we clear this filter (or facet).
Now, add a text facet to the &#8220;Name&#8221; column. Browse the first few
entries. Notice there are a lot of very, very similar names here.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
For the sake of argument, let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re interested in looking at how
much Sen. Joe Bruno got from Nassau police groups. There appear to be 10
groups here with similar names receiving donations for Bruno. Seems like
a good chance that many of these are the same organization. For the sake
of argument, let&#8217;s say your reporting shows that yes, these are the same
group and we want them to all have the same name for our analysis. Hover
your cursor over each one and when the option to &#8220;include&#8221; appears on
the right, click it. Once you&#8217;ve &#8220;included&#8221; them all, click the cluster
button.

</div>

<p><img alt="subfacet" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/subfacet.jpg" title="subfacet" /></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
This will attempt to cluster the choices just in this selection to offer
suggestions on names that could b the same. Change the method to
&#8220;nearest neighbor&#8221; and the distance function to &#8220;<span class="caps">PPM</span>.&#8221; If you merge all
of the offered suggestions under the same name, it will condense six of
the 10 choices into one name. Then you can merge and re-cluster. Once
you clean up all the suggestions, you can browse the data in the facet
one last time and clean up any stragglers individually as needed.
Believe it or not, Refine has just saved you a massive amount of time
and energy.

</div>

<h2 id="what-did-we-learn-here-today">What did we learn here&nbsp;today?</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Refine is a huge time saver and allows you to do commonly tedious data
cleaning tasks with a few clicks of the mouse. We saw how to:  
- Import and export data.  
- Copy and edit columns, trimming whitespaces or changing the
capitalization.  
- Use facets to filter and edit data  
- Cluster a column to standardize spellings and&nbsp;entries.

</p>
This has been a whirlwind sprint through this program, but hopefully
it&#8217;s given you a taste of what it can do.

<p>

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
In an ideal world, we&#8217;d get all of our data handed to us perfectly clean
in easy to access, user-friendly, real time feeds that make for simple
analysis and display.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
But until then, we&#8217;re going to have to wrestle with the murky and messy
datasets produced by those infinite monkeys making an infinite number of
mistakes. Use Refine as your new big gun and never give up the fight.

</div>

<p>And remember, if you let the monkeys who enter data into government
spreadsheets win, this is where it will&nbsp;lead.</p>

<p>
They&#8217;ll make a monkey out of you too.

Finally, if you want to keep messing with Refine, here are a pair of
tutorials that put it much better than I can.
