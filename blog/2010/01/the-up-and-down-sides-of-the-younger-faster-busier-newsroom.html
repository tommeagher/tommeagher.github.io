            <p>Things have been pretty hectic over the last year. The Local News
Service is fully staffed and running at full steam. Over the summer, we
had a baby. Between the two, I&#8217;ve had my hands&nbsp;full.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I was invited to speak on a panel to address the
faculty at Columbia University&#8217;s <a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/">Graduate School of Journalism</a>. It
gave me the opportunity to reflect on <span class="caps">LNS</span>&#8217; first 10 months of operation
and what I&#8217;ve learned. Here&#8217;s a draft of my scripted&nbsp;remarks:</p>
<!--more-->

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s changing, and what isn&#8217;t, in newsrooms&nbsp;today?</strong></p>
<p>Let me start first with a little bit of background, because I get a
lot of questions about what the Local News Service is and how it&#8217;s
related to the&nbsp;Star-Ledger.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Star-Ledger lost about 45 percent of its staff through a
massive buyout. Its parent company, <a href="http://www.advance.net/index.ssf?/advance_publications/about_advance_publications.html">Advance Publications</a>, decided
to set up a separate company to provide local news. This was not
unprecedented. For years, the Ledger&#8217;s high school sports and
obituaries have been done <a href="http://www.oldnewark.com/memories/newspapers/reporter/footnoteone.htm">by an outside outfit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.njlns.com"><span class="caps">LNS</span></a> was launched last year to create a new cost structure and to
fill the local pages of the <a href="http://www.nj.com/starledger/">Star-Ledger</a> and its website,
<a href="http://www.nj.com"><span class="caps">NJ</span>.com</a>.</p>
<p>We have a newsroom of 15 reporters and 3 photographers covering
municipal, local and breaking news in the six core counties of the
Star-Ledger&#8217;s coverage area. Three experienced editors, including
myself and Rick Everett (retired Star-Ledger managing editor), offer
direction, context and&nbsp;guidance.</p>
<p>We have an additional nine or 10 staffers who produce 26 listing
calendars a week as well as community news items, Scouting and schools
news and a history&nbsp;column.</p>
<p>Our purpose is to produce more content for print and online with
fewer, less experienced journalists. At the same time, we want to
maintain the same quality and standards that readers expect of the
state&#8217;s biggest newspaper. And we&#8217;ve done just that. Our photographers
and reporters produce a ton of copy. We have helped bolster the
Ledger&#8217;s zoned county sections, and on occasion, we&#8217;ve contributed
stories to the features, business and sports sections. And while our
primary objective is local news, we&#8217;ve also snagged 27 front page
stories and probably twice as many Jersey section cover pieces since
we went live in&nbsp;March.</p>
<p>Along the way, I&#8217;ve observed a few&nbsp;things:</p>
<p>The competition is changing. Our old enemies have become our new
friends as we join to fight new enemies. We now compete online with
dozens of hyperlocal websites (<a href="http://www.patch.com">Patch</a>, <a href="http://www.baristanet.com/">Baristanet</a>, <a href="http://www.maplewoodonline.com/">Maplewood
Online</a>, <a href="http://maplewood.blogs.nytimes.com/">The Local</a>, etc) as well as our old print foes from the
Gannett papers. At the same time, the Ledger has largely buried the
hatchet with its old rival the Bergen <a href="http://www.northjersey.com">Record</a>, and they now share
most stories and have a combined statehouse bureau in&nbsp;Trenton.</p>
<p>Everything is faster. When we get a breaking news tip, we want to get
it confirmed and get a short version of the story online immediately,
if not sooner. The pace is picking&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Our news gatherers are young. Only one of the 15 we hired was over 30.
This has resulted in the loss of some institutional memory. In many
cases, the veterans who had been in the Ledger&#8217;s county bureaus for
decades are gone. Some are now working as spokesmen for various state
and local agencies and private companies. But they have been replaced,
by and large, by ambitious and energetic reporters who know little to
nothing about New Jersey and its stories. It has been a challenge for
us to fill those gaps while our reporters cover, in some cases, 10 or
more&nbsp;towns.</p>
<p>Although our reporters are sophisticated Web consumers and are
comfortable with blogging, Facebook, shooting photos and even
producing videos, there is no replacement for basic reporting skills.
The most important thing I need from a new reporter is the ability to
ask questions and chase a story. It does me no good if you can make a
sound slide or build a web page if you can&#8217;t find a story, ask
questions and get it right. I&#8217;ve also noticed that as great as it is,
Google has almost grown too popular. I have a reporter who rather than
check the Star-Ledger&#8217;s own, comprehensive online archives when
looking for old clips, she will instead just Google it and see what
hits come up from <span class="caps">NJ</span>.com. She doesn&#8217;t even go to her own website to
look for&nbsp;stories.</p>
<p>All this turmoil and change has been a very tough transition for
readers. Our sources, particularly our favorite gadflies and midlevel
local bureaucrats, have found this very confusing. They had been used
to, in many cases, dealing with the same reporters for a decade or
more. They knew who to call when there was news. Now they don&#8217;t know
who covers what. We have gone to great lengths to get our name out
there. We&#8217;ve sent our reporters to as many meetings and events as we
can in our towns to schmooze residents and officials and explain we&#8217;re
a new operation and get our faces out&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>All of this is, however, exciting. We have a great time doing what we
do. Our reporters, because they haven&#8217;t been poisoned by the malaise
that afflicts many news organizations, really enjoy their jobs. We
have fun going into work every day and chasing the news. We get
excited when one of our people gets a front page&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>In many ways, even as business models evolve, the work we do as
journalists every day hasn&#8217;t changed all that much. We have better
tools to work with in some cases, and we&#8217;ve got to do more, faster,
but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s journalism. I couldn&#8217;t be&nbsp;happier.</p>
