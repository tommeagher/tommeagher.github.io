<p>These notes were compiled from discussions with The Record&#8217;s Passaic
County bureau editor Claude Deltieure. He is incredibly knowledgeable
about local and school budgets in New Jersey and has been very generous
with his&nbsp;time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Budgets are made up of two main sections, revenues (income) and
appropriations (spending). In an ideal world, these two would match&nbsp;up.</p>
</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Revenues</strong>\                                            <strong>Appropriations</strong><br />
  Property taxes\                                          Current expenses (salaries and other expenses)<br />
  State <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Federal aid (fluctuates and may not come)\       Capital outlay (big ticket repairs)<br />
  Miscellaneous revenues (fees, licenses, court costs)\    Debt service (payment on municipal loans)
   Surplus (carried over from last&nbsp;year)                   </p>
<hr />
<p>As Claude is fond of saying, municipal financing New Jersey is &#8220;built
for idiots.&#8221; You have to &#8220;appropriate&#8221; the public dollar to use it for a
specific purpose. The governing body must vote to do this to pay any and
all bills. Capital outlay is defined as durable goods that last more
than three&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>Your job, as a reporter, is to give readers an idea of how their taxes
are going to go up and explain&nbsp;why.</p>
<p>The total property tax bill is made up of several components:<br />
municipal services<br />
schools<br />
county<br />
open space tax<br />
regional district tax<br />
fire<br />
garbage<br />
<a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/losap/losap.shtml">Length of service annuity&nbsp;program</a></p>
<p>The Length of Service annuity is meant to help support volunteer
firefighters and ambulance corps. Each town will pay for a volunteer&#8217;s
equipment, and this money must cover that. One-penny on the tax rate
goes to the annuities to be paid to a volunteer upon&nbsp;retirement.</p>
<p>New Jersey also ran out of landfill space 20 years ago, so it must pay
astronomical amounts to handle its&nbsp;garbage.</p>
<p>Regional districts are shared and provide rural schools that cover
several towns. The towns that &#8220;send&#8221; their students to school in another
town must pay for those&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>You have to tell your readers that the municipal services tax is going
up, not just that taxes as a whole are&nbsp;rising.</p>
<p>The state overseer of all issues regarding local finance is the
<a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/">Division of Local Government Services</a> under the <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/">Department of
Community Affairs</a>. In many ways, it functions like a state version of
the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/"><span class="caps">GAO</span></a>.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">LGS</span> reviews every municipal budget and must approve&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The council does not &#8220;pass&#8221; a budget. It first &#8220;introduces&#8221; it to the
town&#8217;s residents. Once the council introduces a budget, you as a
reporter must be allowed to get a copy. They cannot give you a summary
version. The council will then go on to &#8220;adopt&#8221; the budget. A governing
body in New Jersey must have a two-thirds majority to pass a spending&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p><strong>The impact in dollars and&nbsp;sense</strong></p>
<p>The amount of your property taxes is based on the value of one-penny per
\$100 of the taxable value of your property. Each town hires an
independent assessment firm every few years to perform a &#8220;revaluation&#8221;
of its properties. On that, it bases its property tax&nbsp;assessments.</p>
<p>The tax rate is based on how much money your town collected last year.
If you only collected 95 percent of the taxes last year, you can collect
105 percent this&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>That extra 5 percent, if you can collect it, is set aside as a &#8220;reserve
for uncollected taxes&#8221;. If this year you collect 98 percent of your
taxes, that extra 2 percent goes into your surplus and reserve. The
reserve is anything you didn&#8217;t spend last&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>The surplus in the current budget comes out of last year&#8217;s reserve.
Towns will often underestimate their expected tax collection rate, or
overestimate their appropriations so that at the end of the fiscal year,
they will have money left over to build their surplus. A surplus should
be between 3 and 5 percent of the total budget. You need to be able to
communicate to your readers this pull-and-tug of making the revenues and
appropriations match&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>You need to know how many tax dollars come into your town if you collect
one penny per \$100 of assessed&nbsp;valuation.</p>
<p>First, call your town&#8217;s tax assessor and ask for the total valuation of
your town. You can also find it on the <span class="caps">LGS</span>&#8217; Web site <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/taxes/taxmenu.shtml">here</a>. If the
total value of your town is \$3 billion, one tax point will raise
\$300,000. So for every \$300,000 in spending the city plans, it will
levy one point in&nbsp;taxes.</p>
<p>To apply that to the average reader, multiply the tax-point times the
average assessed value of a property in your town. Again, you can find
this out from your tax assessor (who really should become your best
friend), or from the&nbsp;<span class="caps">LGS</span>.</p>
<p>So if the average property in your town is worth \$100,000, and your
council wants to buy a \$1.2 million jet for the mayor, how much will
that cost your average&nbsp;taxpayer?</p>
<p>To find the average tax rate for each person: Divide \$100,000 by \$100
and then by 100 pennies. That gives you \$10. So for each tax point that
the town raises its taxes, the average homeowner will pay \$10 more. If
the municipality pays for the entire \$1.2 million jet, that will cost 4
tax points (\$1.2 million divided by \$300,000 per tax point). That will
cost your average taxpayer \$40 more each year (4 tax points times \$10
per point for the average&nbsp;home).</p>
<p>Figuring this out can help you paint spending decisions in a way readers
can grasp. You should have these base figures&#8212;the total valuation, the
tax point and the average value of a home&#8212;handy for each of your&nbsp;towns.</p>
<p>School districts also receive state aid based on a formula. The state
expects each district to pay \$10,000 each year to educate each student.
The state looks at the average income and property values of each town
to see how much it can afford of that \$10,000 per student. If it
doesn&#8217;t have the money, the state will pay for the essentials. But arts
and other programs, such as music, can not receive this &#8220;state
equalization aid&#8221; from&nbsp;Trenton.</p>
<p>These budgets can be very confusing, but as a reporter, you need to
learn as much as you can about how they work. You must be able to talk
shop with elected officials about the budgets to be able to detect
attempts at slipping items through without the public&#8217;s&nbsp;notice.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>By Tom</strong><br />
When we&#8217;re writing budget stories, local officials often omit key
numbers that every reader wants to know. To help ensure that you don&#8217;t
forget to press them to fill in the blanks, here&#8217;s a handy checklist of
the key figures you need to ask for. Every budget story must include
this&nbsp;graf:</p>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Under the adopted (proposed) 2010 budget, the owner of a home
assessed at the borough average of \$65,000 will pay \$2,395 in
municipal (school/county) taxes, a rise of \$99.70 from last year or
4.4&nbsp;percent.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember:<br />
1. The fiscal year<br />
2. The average home assessment<br />
3. The total amount of that average municipal/school/county tax bill<br />
4. The total dollar increase in the average tax bill<br />
5. The percent increase in the average tax&nbsp;bill</p>
