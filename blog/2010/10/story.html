<p>1.Write tight. Maybe the most important thing you can do to increase
your productivity without doing more work is to write tight and trim
your own work. Write briefs instead of 8 inchers. Write 8 inchers
instead of 10 inchers. Write 10-12s instead of 12-15s. Write 12-15s
instead of 15-18s. The tighter you write, the less time it takes and the
more time you free up for other stuff. Time is a gift to the news
reporter. Use that extra hour or half hour to stop in on your beat, talk
to a couple sources on the phone, read online what other newspapers are
doing, or skim-read documents or&nbsp;reports.</p>
<p>​2. Prewrite/outline. Whether you sweat over your copy or it flows from
your fingers like hot fudge, prewriting saves you time and energy. Take
five to 10 minutes before you start to think how am I going to handle my
story. Look at your notes and materials. Make yourself a thumbnail
outline. What&#8217;s your lede? What&#8217;s your best quote(s)? What&#8217;s the news
important to readers? What&#8217;s the background? What&#8217;s the context? Once
you&#8217;ve got a bijou outline, you&#8217;ve got a roadmap. Drive, she&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>​3. Demand coaching. Editors know they need to story conference and
coach writing and help with resources and ideas, but things get hectic
and sometimes they don&#8217;t. That does not mean you should not ask advice
and coaching. The crucial times to talk to an editor are: before you
start reporting; after you finish reporting, but before you start
writing; when you&#8217;ve got a top; and, of course, when you have to make a
late decision on whether the story holds up, reaching an alternate
source,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>4.Master the art of the weekbook. It can&#8217;t be said too often or
emphasized too much: the weekbook is the key to excellent and efficient
performance. At its basic level, the weekbook is a scheduling device. To
take your weekbook to a higher level of value requires the additional
ingredient: forethought. Here are several specific practices that can
improve your weekbook - as well as your editors&#8217; esteem and your job&nbsp;satisfaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a good mix of stories every week. No one wants to do the same
    thing day after day. Build concise dailies around news events,
    meetings, issues. Build in patches (centerpieces) by thinking what
    will make a good photo story. Build a weekend story every week by
    giving yourself a couple hours early to midweek to report, a day or
    three quarters day midweek to late week to write. Build in
    overnights with a 2 p.m. deadline, freeing up an afternoon for
    weekend story or enterprise work. Put in a strong daily Monday to
    anchor the week and a timeless news feature, profile or human
    interest story later in the week, that can be used on the&nbsp;weekend.</li>
<li>News stories break like waves. It&#8217;s coming (preview), it breaks<br />
    (hard news) and recedes (impact, folo, news feature, analysis,
    preview of<br />
    next stage). Think of that wave shape. Ride the wave and you&#8217;ll get
    three or more hits off one news&nbsp;event.</li>
<li>Add a line called <span class="caps">FOLO</span> beneath every budget line in your weekbook.
    After you&#8217;ve finished your story, go back and give yourself leads to
    follow up: sources not reached, questions unanswered on deadline,
    possible profiles of people in the news, impact of an event, stories
    that ask why? And how? instead of just who, what, where and when.
    Readers&#8217; surveys often indicate that one of the things readers
    dislike is hit and miss coverage, especially one day wonders.
    Readers want closure. They want the rest of the story. Use the <span class="caps">FOLO</span>
    line to help fill your next&nbsp;weekbook.</li>
<li>Make your weekbook a living document. Go back and change it, add to
    it, as the week goes along. It only takes a minute. Then re-mine
    that weekbook in subsequent&nbsp;weeks.</li>
<li>If you know you are going to be working on a weekend, start talking
    to your weekend editor about your story early in the week. There&#8217;s
    nothing more awful than a reporter in panic on Thursday afternoon
    with no idea what to cover on Saturday or&nbsp;Sunday.</li>
</ul>
<p>​4. Team up with colleagues. It&#8217;s challenging, it&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s
productive. And<br />
it gives readers from various towns some sense of how news cuts across<br />
municipal&nbsp;boundaries.</p>
<p>​5. Keep a tickler file, aka a futures file; fill it with clips,
letters,<br />
notes, pictures, labels and related junk of every variety from which
story<br />
ideas will emerge. Review it now and&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>​6. Don&#8217;t fall into the rut of thinking there are no good stories on
your<br />
beat. Instead, try to attack same-old stories from different,
imaginative<br />
angles. Write more stories on how news impacts our towns and people.
Write local trend stories. Write community crime trend stories. Write
service pieces that inform readers about things they never thought they
wanted to know and help readers make decisions. Write local business
pieces. Write local environmental stories. Write more people stories,
and especially more profiles. People like to read about people. Put a
human face on as many stories as you possibly&nbsp;can.</p>
<p>​7. Remember <a href="/third/">listening posts</a> for increasing the diversity of our
sources and scope? Start doing them one day per period, as required. If
you can&#8217;t do a full day, spend a few hours one day and a few hours
another day. Add new sources to your regular news coverage. Add new
voices to the mix of sources. The Herald News should never become a
city/town hall&nbsp;newspaper!</p>
<p>​8. We can do the short-term investigation. We can do investigations
that depend more on human intelligence than massive data analysis. We
can reveal sides of life in our coverage area that no one knows. Try to
rethink your investigative ambitions. Go for the clean, short, effective
strike. Go for the Wow! Factor: the story that makes readers say to
themselves, &#8220;Wow, I didn&#8217;t know&nbsp;that!&#8221;</p>
<p>​9. Revisit stories. Many reporters know to keep a futures file. Many<br />
know to revisit certain stories on a temporal basis (after one year,
five<br />
years, 10 years etc.). This best practice adds another revisit
category: the revisit to the incomplete story. Sometimes, try as we
might, we simply cannot get the full story by deadline time. Typically,
an important source is missing or evasive. Or an agency delays an
answer. Or a document can&#8217;t be obtained. There are many forms of this.
We go with what we&#8217;ve got. But when there&#8217;s a significant hole in the
article, we owe it to readers to revisit the story as soon as we can and
follow up with a second story or brief. This is especially true when the
missing information changes the way we covered the story previously.
This best practice speaks to both accuracy and thoroughness- two
important parts of getting it right, which is our basic contract with&nbsp;readers.</p>
<p>​10. Morgue. Many of you are checking the digital library for articles<br />
going back for years (to 1998) as part of your routine reporting. All
of<br />
you should be doing this every day. In addition, however, please don&#8217;t<br />
forget that the library has a paper morgue going back donkey years.
It&#8217;s a<br />
good practice to check this, particularly when articles involve people
who<br />
don&#8217;t show up in the digital. Ask Mauro Margarelli to help you find
the<br />
files you&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>​11. Eight Ways to Tell a Story. One of the most useful handouts Warren<br />
Watson of <span class="caps">API</span> left behind is the one put together by the York Daily
Record editor about the local kid who won a dance contest. She wrote the
same story in eight different ways, from inverted period to Q&amp;A, to
photo package, blocks, narrative and beyond. This is a handy document
that all should have and refer to. If you don&#8217;t have it, see Jonathan
for a copy. If you do have it, use it. God did not hand down the
inverted pyramid on stone tablets. Many stories can be told better in
other ways. Just as no one likes to eat the exact same thing three times
a day, readers, too, want variety. You can still present serious news
information in entertaining ways. It just takes thought, creativity and
effort. The reporter&#8217;s job is always to make what she finds relevant
interesting for the&nbsp;reader.</p>

<p>1.Three <strong>Narrative Dailies</strong>.</p>
<p>Narrative journalism is often associated, in journalists&#8217; minds, with<br />
lengthy enterprise projects. But there is no law saying narrative
techniques cannot be used in dailies or short form. At the recent
Niemann Narrative Conference at Harvard, I jotted down three types of
daily stories that we could start doing to tell stories in new,
interesting and insightful ways for <span class="caps">HN</span> readers. Below, three generic
budget lines. Use them in good health, with one caveat: narrative
doesn&#8217;t mean you can make it&nbsp;up.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TICKTOCK</span></p>
<p>We take a news event, breaking or second day reporting. Instead of<br />
organizing from the most important in the lead to the least important
at the end, we reconstruct the event over time. What led up to that
explosion? What happened the night that cop was murdered? What did that
family do on the day they died in a car crash? Exactly what steps did
the mayor take that allowed him to pass a zero increase budget? Or,
alternatively, what is the aftermath of a particular news event? What
happened minute by minute after the plane crashed? What happened to the
freeholder in the days and weeks after he dropped out of third&nbsp;grade?</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECONDDRAFT</span></p>
<p>Journalism is often called the first draft of history. But the first
draft<br />
is often abbreviated and cursory, sometimes underreported or skewed,
and in some cases, wrong. In this story type, we take a second look at a
breaking story, going back to sources for a fuller or better account,
taking an unexpected angle or digging out some universal human truth
from what at first ran as a brief or rushed deadline piece. The goal is
truth, not just&nbsp;facts.</p>
<p><span class="caps">EXPLAINER</span></p>
<p>Narrative methods focusing on one person can often help readers
understand complex, novel or unfamiliar issues and processes better than
conventional reporting - which often overlooks the explanatory.
Bankruptcy. Identity theft. Outsourcing. Uninsured. Poverty level.
Daycare. Drug addiction. Productivity. Deregulation. Bond rating. And on
and on. In the explainer, we use one person&#8217;s story to give readers
insight into a hard-to-get-at&nbsp;topic.</p>
<p>​2. Three types of <strong>profiles</strong>.</p>
<p>We tend to think of profiles, if we think of them at all, as one thing:<br />
stories about people. It took Bill Blundell, former Page One editor at
the<br />
Wall Street Journal has three types of&nbsp;profiles:</p>
<p>​a. The General Profile: Concentrates on unique qualities of subject,<br />
aspects of difference: what makes this person unique, different,<br />
outstanding, unusual, unconventional, nontraditional, nonstandard,
peculiar, pale and&nbsp;interesting?</p>
<p>​b. The Microcosm Profile: centers on aspects of sameness,
universality.<br />
In what ways is this person or this person&#8217;s story typical, universal,<br />
human, like all of us? What part of her or her story can we all
connect<br />&nbsp;with?</p>
<p>​c. The News Profile: centers on the subject&#8217;s connection to a news<br />
event. Also could be called, as the Times does (or used to): Man in
the<br />
News. Person in the&nbsp;News?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jonathan Maslow</em>, June&nbsp;2004</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-enterprise-project">The Enterprise&nbsp;project</h2>
<p>In our conference call with Cleveland Plain Dealer writer Connie
Schultz, she mentioned several methods that helped her narrative series
&#8220;The Burden of Innocence,&#8221; which was the subject of our brown bag
writers group. They are excellent practices, not only for narrative
journalism, but for any enterprise&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>​1) <strong>Write as you go</strong>.</p>
<p>Schultz said she always transcribed her notes as soon as possible and
kept them in files organized by month as she worked on the series over
the course of one year. Any project that involves reporting over time
benefits from having well-organized notes from interviews and reporting.
It puts the writer ahead of the curve when you get down to the business
of writing. This practice can be easily extended to the practice of
writing<br />
themes, sections, scenes, dialogue, good quotes, etc. as you go. Don&#8217;t
imagine you can wait until you&#8217;re reporting is done, then look back at
your notebooks or journal and suddenly pull the white rabbit out of the
hat. Doesn&#8217;t work like&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>​2) <strong>Writing a Map/ outline</strong>.</p>
<p>Schultz said that before she started to write, her editor asked for a
written map, a term she described as having less onerous associations
than outline. The map or outline provides writer and editor with a guide
to the story, where it starts, where it goes, what it&#8217;s about, where it
ends. It makes the writer think. It need not be followed like a
contract. Whatever it&#8217;s called, this best practice is one of the
quintessential building blocks of longer-length writing. Without it, you
are, effectively, roaming around blindfolded, hoping to pin the tail on
the donkey. With a roadmap or outline, even if rudimentary (many are the
outlines noted on the back of a cocktail napkin; Tolstoy outlined Anna
Karenina on a railroad train dining car menu (which, however, later fell
behind the sofa at his estate Yasnaya Polyana, forcing him to write War
<span class="amp">&amp;</span> Peace first instead, but that is another story)).you can focus on the
material and how to express it accurately, faily and gracefully, not on
what to write&nbsp;next.</p>
<p>​3) <strong>Rewriting</strong>.</p>
<p>Schultz said rewriting was the most painful part&#8212; she went through a
dozen major drafts. But rewriting is an absolutely necessary practice to
achieve successful narratives/enterprise stories. If you are to become a
skilled pro writer, you must get past the idea that rewriting means you
are doing something wrong. Rewriting is, in fact, doing something right:
Improving the story, draft by draft. No story has ever suffered from
rewriting. Many suffered from too little rewriting. Just as the
map/outline helps the writer through the first draft, the editor&#8217;s read
and conferencing helps the writer through rewrite. Talk out what needs
to be done. Partner. Writers don&#8217;t need to accept everything an editor
says, like medicine or punishment. Writers do need to defend and
articulate something they want to keep. Develop a collaborative rewrite
strategy and get to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>​4) <strong>Writing buddies</strong>.</p>
<p>Scultz said she chooses another writer in the newsroom she respects to
critique her pieces, so that she has an additional sounding board
outside the editors-reporter loop. Practically every mature writer does
this, asking colleagues or friends to read the work and tell the brutal
truth. However, this practice really depends on choosing someone with
good judgment, analytical skill and the ability to articulate and
criticize> constructively. Anything less is less than&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jonathan Maslow</em>, April&nbsp;2003</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="edit-proof-copy"><a href="/files/tips/editproofmanual.pdf">Edit Proof&nbsp;copy</a></h2>
<p>​1. The reporter&#8217;s constant focus should be on the question: <strong>what is
this story about?</strong> That helps shape the lede, the angle, the structure,
everything. Also, editors should keep reporters focused on this question
throughout the day so that the reporter refines and hones the story to
present the reader with a tight, concise, well-organized story without
holes, digressions or&nbsp;frills.</p>
<p>​2. There&#8217;s a natural contradiction between the creative process and<br />
critical thinking, between writer or storyteller inside us and the
editor or<br />
critic inside. The critic suppresses the storyteller and makes it
harder for<br />
the storyteller to tell the story. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so hard to write a
solid<br />
lede: every time the storyteller wants to put a thought down, the
critic<br />
says ,&#8221;that stinks,&#8221; &#8220;that&#8217;s not good enough.&#8221; So Chip Scanlon talked
about &#8220;lowering your standards&#8221; when you draft your story. I think a
better way to say this is to suspend your critical faculties while you
are writing your first draft and just get it down using your creative
juices. Then switch over to your critical faculties to rewrite, sharpen,
trim,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>​3. <strong>A topic is not a story</strong>. You can&#8217;t write about <span class="caps">AIDS</span>, or mass
transit, or affordable housing. Those are topics. A story has to have a
beginning, middle and end. It has to have characters. It has to have a
plot.<br />
It has to have a setting. This is a cogent point. How many times do
editors hear from reporters, &#8220;I want to write about poverty in
Paterson.&#8221; &#8220;I want to write about the Passaic River.&#8221; &#8220;I want to write
about race relations between latinos and blacks.&#8221; How many times do
reporters hear from editors: &#8220;We should do a story about high property
taxes.&#8221; Well what about it? Themes are not stories. Think about telling
stories. It&#8217;s&nbsp;elemental.</p>
<p>​4. Words of wisdom from Don Murray, a legendary writing coach, on<br />
organizing and &#8220;mapping&#8221; the reporting and writing of a story:
<strong>explore, focus, rehearse, draft, clarify</strong>.</p>
<p>​5. Experienced reporters know what is the least amount of reporting<br />
they need to do for any given story. Great reporters know there is no
limit<br />
except deadline for reporting, and that the quality of a story really,
truly<br />
depends on the reporting, not the writing. If you don&#8217;t know as many
facts<br />
and factoids as you possibly can, the story is going to be thin and
pale.<br />
Somebody said, &#8220;Reporting is taking a beer keg information and
squeezing it into a perfume&nbsp;bottle.</p>
<p>​6. A good way to start the process: reporter and editor brainstorm<br />
on reader&#8217;s questions. What does the reader need to and want to know
about the story. That helps the reporter focuse on question above: What
is this story&nbsp;about?</p>
<p>​7. Rick Bragg&#8217;s five boxes. <span class="caps">NY</span> Times reporter Rick Bragg learned<br />
from a mentor that he should organize and write his stories as if he
had<br />
five empty boxes floating in the air above him: In the first box, he
put the<br />
lede or grabber. In the second, the nut graf: what&#8217;s this story about.
In<br />
the third box, tell the story. In the fourth, info, context, back
story,<br />
etc. And in the fifth, the kicker, the ending, something that leaves
the<br />
reader with emotional&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>​8. Jack Hart, enterprise editor at The Oregonian: Don&#8217;t confuse<br />
anecdotes in anecdotal ledes with scenesetters. <strong>Anecdotes are little
stories, with their own beginning and end. Scenesetters just get the
reader to the right&nbsp;&#8220;place.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>​9. Get rid of dependent clauses in your&nbsp;sentences.</p>
<p>​10. <strong>To revise, you need to achieve distance</strong>. You can&#8217;t plunge right
into a revision. You have to take a break, do something else for a
while, eat something or drink something, divert your attention, go for a
walk, something. Everyone finds their own way to get a distance on
his/her own work. Whatever cools the engine down then revs it up&nbsp;again.</p>

<p>Anything you think you know, turn it into a&nbsp;question.</p>
<p>Ask&nbsp;yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you want to&nbsp;know?</li>
<li>What are you curious&nbsp;about?</li>
<li>Who are the stakeholders in the&nbsp;story?</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, do this again so you have ideas for second day&nbsp;stories.</p>
<p>On most stories, you write the first-day story. On the second day, you
do a story that&#8217;s very wide, takes in all the questions but is not very&nbsp;deep.</p>
<p>Instead, do six or seven deep stories of varying&nbsp;types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profiles -&nbsp;character-based</li>
<li>Issues/trends - ideas,&nbsp;fashion</li>
<li>Investigative -&nbsp;records-based</li>
<li>Explanatory - a teachable&nbsp;moment</li>
<li>Descriptive/voices - use telling&nbsp;details</li>
<li>Narratives - scenes <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;dialogue</li>
<li>Visuals - using graphics and boxes to tell the&nbsp;story</li>
</ul>
<p>Editors want a working <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&amp;aid=34457">nut graf</a> when you pitch a story. Do some
preliminary&nbsp;reporting.</p>
<p>Each editor is looking for something different, get to know each of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Writing a budget line helps you establish goals. Write your working
budget line as&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>Find a colleague who will read your ledes in progress and to discuss
story craft&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>Ledes engage the reader. Don&#8217;t misdirect the reader. Lede them with
foreshadowing and&nbsp;summarize.</p>
<p>Unlike the <span class="caps">AP</span>, don&#8217;t frontload a lot of&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>The lede should signal the tone and voice of the&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>Vary the pacing and rhythm and length of your sentences. Long sentences
read fast. Then a short sentance halts the&nbsp;reader.</p>
