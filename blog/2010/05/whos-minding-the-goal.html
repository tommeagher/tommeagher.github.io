            <p>After <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2010/05/no-cheering-in-the-press-box/">yesterday&#8217;s discussion</a>, some might ask the obvious question:
aren&#8217;t there already people doing&nbsp;this?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t intend to denigrate the years of service by so many passionate
and intelligent fans. I wish they could have been compensated even a
fraction for the sweat they&#8217;ve poured into writing about the&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>And with varying degrees of success, some organizations are attempting
what I propose, to support legions of writers with the values and
resources of their ancestors in newsprint. There&#8217;s a battalion, at
least, of <a href="http://twitter.com/RichardFarley">podcasters</a>. There are networks of soccer scribes
like <a href="http://american-soccer-news.com/">American-Soccer-News.com</a>. And then there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/">MLSsoccer.com</a>.</p>
<p>There has been a little debate about whether fans should consider
MLSsoccer.com to be a legitimate and credible news outlet. Forget for a
moment that no other major organizations provide comprehensive reporting
on the domestic leagues (even though one would expect that <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team/_/team/660/united-states?cc=5901&amp;ver=us"><span class="caps">ESPN</span></a> or
<a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/usa">Fox Soccer</a> would want to mount such an effort) and that <span class="caps">MLS</span> is
simply stepping into the breach to give fans what they want.  With the
sweeping inhouse relaunch of the site this season, the league and its
employees clearly plan to &#8220;cover&#8221; the sport, both here and abroad. But
should they, and if not, what role should the league&#8217;s official website&nbsp;play?</p>

<p>We need to remind ourselves that MLSsoccer.com is the public relations
arm of a major corporation. Many fans would agree that we really can&#8217;t
trust the site to give us honest, straightforward reportage on issues
that are less than flattering to the league as a whole. As other writers
(including [one at the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Mens National Team Players Association&#8217;s
official website][]) have observed, it&#8217;s like watching a snake eat its
own tail when you try to get information from an official mouthpiece
that also attempts to cover the news. You don&#8217;t rely on the Federal
Reserve for unbiased, critical and important writing about <span class="caps">U.S.</span> monetary
policy. You don&#8217;t need to do it with your favorite sport&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>MLSsoccer.com ought to be a repository of fast, easy-to-find video and
(I credit this concept entirely to <a href="http://soccer.fakesigi.com/2010/04/mls-website-panic-switch.html">FakeSigi</a>) openly accessible
statistical data. The site should create a public <span class="caps">API</span> to allow fans to
use the league&#8217;s entire database of historical game and player
statistics. One can imagine how a blog like <a href="http://usasoccer.blogspot.com/">Climbing the Ladder</a>,
which I believe does its analysis with its own cobbled-together data,
could be even cooler if it had the actual league stats to tinker&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>Although MLSsoccer.com is keeping more than a few people gainfully
employed, I want to see more organizations spring up so that so many
writers aren&#8217;t directly dependent on the league to make a living. We
need to find ways to support good, young soccer writers so they can
work, report and get better at their craft without having to shill for&nbsp;<span class="caps">MLS</span>.</p>
<h2 id="unravel-the-conflicting-interests">Unravel the conflicting&nbsp;interests</h2>
<p>Outside MLSsoccer.com, much of the writing on the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> game resembles
the pamphleteering of the early Republic. Lots of Whigs and Federalists
write blogs for like-minded folks, but their own biases can make them
hard to take&nbsp;seriously.</p>
<p>Although some good coverage of the sport comes from partisans, I don&#8217;t
want the writer on whom I rely to be staked in the camp of any one team.
There shouldn&#8217;t be any fans in the press box. Stories and podcasts about
games shouldn&#8217;t include the word &#8220;we.&#8221; Soccer fans are incredibly
passionate, and they go to great lengths to identify with their teams.
But I want knowledgeable, independent writers, free of the auspices of
the league and its card-carrying supporters&nbsp;clubs.</p>
<p>To this end, I&#8217;d like to see American soccer writers, professional and
amateur, adopt the ethical guidelines of the <a href="http://apsportseditors.org/">Associated Press Sports
Editors</a>. As an organization, the <a href="http://www.soccerreporters.com/">North American Soccer Reporters</a>
should publicly lean on its members, particularly those not affiliated
with news agencies with their own ethics policies, to subscribe <a href="http://apsportseditors.org/apse-ethics-guidelines/">to this
code</a>. It reads, in&nbsp;part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editors and reporters should avoid taking part in outside activities
or employment that might create conflict of interest or even
appearance of a&nbsp;conflict.</p>
<ol>
<li>They should not serve as an official scorer at baseball&nbsp;games.</li>
<li>They should not write for team or league media guides or other
    team or league publications. This has the potential of
    compromising a reporter’s disinterested&nbsp;observations.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>As fans, we pay to support soccer in this country, whether in satellite
packages or scarves. If for no other reason than we want to make sure
that our money is well spent, we should expect the people who deliver
the news to be minding the bank rather than boosting their club. The
only hitch: we may have to pay more to get what we&nbsp;deserve.</p>
<h2 id="no-more-free-transfers">No more free&nbsp;transfers</h2>
<p>At the very least, we need more neutral, unaffiliated writers who embody
the traditional values of newspaper journalism. In an ideal world, that
would come with a major investment to create a news organization that
could do justice to soccer&#8217;s huge potential in this&nbsp;country.</p>
<p>So far, there have been a handful of single proprietors who have been
successful at making a living on the internet as soccer hacks, most
notably my former <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/">Herald News</a> colleague <a href="http://www.soccerbyives.typepad.com/">Ives Galarcep</a>. But I&#8217;m
proposing an online publication that would require the footprint and
resources of a larger organization to make it&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/daed.2010.139.2.26">several&#8212;largely untested&#8212;business models</a> that, with the
right editorial direction and an angel investor or two, could produce
soccer news worth paying for. Not everything needs to be locked behind a
pay wall. Until relatively recently, <a href="http://www.socceramerica.com/">Soccer America</a> did just that, a
print-focused decision that could be argued largely blunted its
influence as the demand for soccer news on the web exploded. I&#8217;m not
advocating for any particular model, whether its based on subscriptions,
syndication, micropayments or the like. But readers need to understand
that you can really only get the stories you want when a publication can
pay for the work it takes to dig them&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Early in my career, I wrote about the Kansas City Wizards for Cyber
Soccer Associates, a group that still exists and now maintains the
<a href="http://american-soccer-news.com/">American Soccer News</a> site. For two seasons,
I followed the team, writing game previews and match reports. I hesitate
to say I &#8220;covered&#8221; the Wizards. As a part-time writer, I didn&#8217;t have the
time to attend training sessions, and I really had no idea what I was
doing. I didn&#8217;t develop stories or break news. I mostly reacted and
transcribed game events. It was a great gig, but in retrospect I see the
missed opportunities to go deeper. The model of American Soccer News,
and I believe <a href="http://www.theoffside.com/">The Offside</a> as well, is to create a network of
volunteer writers dedicated to individual teams and link them all under
one banner. It&#8217;s a great idea, but it falls short in a couple of key
aspects: it&#8217;s a part-time gig at best, and there&#8217;s a tendency for the
writers to be advocates for the teams rather than probing&nbsp;journalists.</p>
<p>This all leads me once more to a key question, as <a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/2009/11/long-winded-post-on-future-of-soccer.html">Richard Whittall</a>
has asked time and&nbsp;again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t most soccer bloggers secretly consider a career writing for a
major news organization with all its resources, access, accreditation
and living-ish wages, the ultimate endgame for their online&nbsp;endeavours?</p>
<p>&#8230;Is this after all just a fun little hobby? And if not, what are we
all going to do about it? Are traditional pay-for-content models
really and truly&nbsp;dead?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The newspaper industry has largely ignored soccer, but the values of the
daily print journalist are hard to beat. And the truly good newspaper
reporter is impossible to replace for free. With all the writers
slogging away at this subject, we have the raw talent. We have the
knowledge. We have a market for the news. The soccer fan should be an
advertiser&#8217;s dream demographic. We need the business acumen that can
monetize the news so that writers can make the jump from dedicated and
sometimes gifted amateurs to professional reporters, with all the
accountability and responsibility that&nbsp;entails.</p>
<p>There are two things on which American soccer fans can generally agree.
We want thriving, world-class domestic leagues, for both men and women,
and we want the men&#8217;s national team to win the World Cup. At this point,
we&#8217;re decades, if not generations away from realizing those dreams. But
we can get there by taking one step at a time, and the most important
step is to keep the sport alive here long enough for it to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>A vigorous press, despite its shortcomings, has always been vital for a
strong democracy. For soccer to continue to grow in America, we need a
stronger, independent press. To do it right, to have professional
reporters competing to break stories in every city with a team, it will
cost money. For soccer fans and other interested readers, it may be end
up being cheap, but it won&#8217;t be free. At the end of the day, for the
sport we all love, it will be a small price to&nbsp;pay.</p>
