            <p>As anyone who&#8217;s stumbled upon my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ultracasual/">Twitter feed</a> can tell you, I&#8217;m a
soccer fan whose zeal for the sport approaches fanaticism. But over the
last 15 years, I&#8217;ve driven myself crazy trying to find news about the
professional game in all its domestic incarnations, whether it be <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com">Major
League Soccer</a>, <a href="http://www.womensprosoccer.com/">Women&#8217;s Professional Soccer</a> or one of the <a href="http://www.ussoccer.com/USSF-D2-Pro-League/USSF-D2-Pro-League.aspx">lower
divisions</a>.</p>
<p>I make my living editing local news&#8212;town councils, zoning boards,
school boards&#8212;for a daily newspaper. It&#8217;s been doubly frustrating for
me then that a large majority of my colleagues in the media consider
soccer to be a third-class&nbsp;sport.</p>
<p>By and large, soccer is ignored or, at best, squirreled away among the
agate results, somewhere behind junior high water polo. Much has been
written in the blogosphere about how soccer is a sport <a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/2010/03/some-thoughts-on-internet-and-football.html">tailor-made for
the internet</a>. With the advent over the past couple of years of
prevalent, cheap and quick streaming video, anyone can now watch live
games from around the world. You don&#8217;t need broadcasters to watch the
game. And you don&#8217;t need your major metropolitan daily newspaper to read
about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Frustrated by the willful ignorance of newspapers and <span class="caps">TV</span>, soccer fans
like me have created their own media. Blogs, webzines, podcasts and
other online publications have proliferated, sustained by fans who
weren&#8217;t getting the news and analysis they wanted. In many ways,
American fans have provided a perfect example of the &#8220;citizen
journalism&#8221; movement that <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/">Jeff Jarvis</a> has been preaching about all
these&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been great to see the level of engagement by so many regular fans,
but I still find myself yearning for more. I want deeper reporting,
better writing and smarter analysis. I want it all packaged in an
attractive design, and I want more of it every day. I daydream about a
soccer publication that embodies some of the best values of newspaper
journalism infused with all the potential of the digital&nbsp;realm.</p>

<h2 id="a-familiar-refrain">A familiar&nbsp;refrain</h2>
<p>Many of the better critics and writers in the soccer blogosphere have
tackled this subject before. I&#8217;m certainly not alone. <a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/">A More Splendid
Life</a>, <a href="http://pitchinvasion.net/">Pitch Invasion</a>, <a href="http://www.thisisamericansoccer.com/">This is American Soccer</a> and others far
more clever and thoughtful than me have bemoaned the same problem. A lot
of readers want better coverage of the sport, on both the professional
and amateur levels. But there are so few opportunities to make <a href="http://pitchinvasion.net/blog/2009/11/18/the-sweeper-the-future-of-soccer-journalism-debate/">a living
at soccer writing</a>, it&#8217;s difficult to expect anyone to answer the
Siren call as anything more than a&nbsp;hobby.</p>
<p>The problem begins with the big mainstream purveyors of sports
journalism, the newspapers and magazines that have traditionally funded
serious and ongoing reporting. They won&#8217;t, for the most part, touch
soccer. Sure, we&#8217;ll see a few features between now and <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/">July 11</a>, but
that&#8217;s about it. At many publications, if they even have a soccer
writer, he or she is pretty far down in the newsroom pecking order.
They&#8217;re lucky if their stories get any kind of play on the cover of the
sports section at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Fine. We&#8217;ve spent the better part of two decades whining about this.
Soccer speaks for itself. The market for the game is growing and will
continue to expand for some time to come. As <a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/2010/03/some-thoughts-on-internet-and-football.html%20%20">Richard Whittall</a>
correctly&nbsp;observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And as large, ungainly media outlets are forced to cut costs and
broaden content, in-depth sports journalism will be left to a sea of
independent, often fan-biased bloggers working with their own
resources. Many club supporters will be smarter, more connected, and
more knowledgeable as information about club and league power
structures are exposed to an increasingly-global fan&nbsp;base.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vibrant and growing community of writers that has evolved online has
been a great (if only partial) antidote. In some ways, this grassroots
journalism resembles the punk rock and Jamaican music scenes of the &#8216;60s
and &#8216;70s. If you don&#8217;t find what you want, do it yourself. This attitude
has served soccer well at a time when the internet enables anyone with
the chutzpah to pretend to be an expert and the free time to devote to
it to become a soccer pundit with hundreds, if not thousands of
followers. The laptop and Wordpress are the three chords of the internet
revolution. Anyone can do it, and when the &#8220;professionals&#8221; won&#8217;t, anyone&nbsp;will.</p>
<h2 id="the-super-subs">The super&nbsp;subs</h2>
<p>As I researched this piece, I kept finding (or being reminded of) more
and more examples of very nice work being done by amateurs, bloggers and
professionals&nbsp;alike.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s The Run of Play, whose <a href="http://www.runofplay.com/2010/04/22/mourinho-guardiola/">ether binge cultural criticism</a> is
nothing if not fascinating (not to mention its design, which is truly
unique in this genre). There&#8217;s the pseudonymous Fake Sigi (a Fake Steve
Jobs aimed at those who follow one of Major League Soccer&#8217;s most
successful and rotund coaches, Sigi Schmid), whose <a href="http://www.fakesigi.com/2010/04/mls-web-site-disaster.html">scathing dissection
and analysis</a> of the league-run mouthpiece, MLSsoccer.com, has been a
real revelation in recent&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the fan-oriented networks of bloggers and podcasters who
spend countless hours watching, breaking down and reviewing matches.
Many of them conduct interviews with players, coaches and officials as
well as journalists and fellow fans. <a href="http://www.seeingredny.com/">Seeing Red</a>, a relatively new
podcast covering the New York Red Bulls, has been a valuable addition
this season to the coverage of the team from the fan&#8217;s&nbsp;seats.</p>
<p><em>(In the spirit of full disclosure, over the past six years, I have
edited a pair of soccer blogs, on my own and for my former newspaper.
Those experiences, and their unceremonious ends, give me even more
respect for those who continue to slog away at the daily grind of&nbsp;blogging.)</em></p>
<p>Add to these the traditional newspaper and magazine journalists who have
taken to the web and social networks to hone their brand and solidify
their command of the beat: <a href="http://www.soccerbyives.net/">Ives Galarcep</a>, <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/">Steve Goff</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/grantwahl">Grant
Wahl</a>, <a href="http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/">Jack Bell</a> and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to like. Still, we can and should all expect a lot&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Understandably, some bloggers and amateur reporters can adopt a
defensive posture on the subject of professionalism. It&#8217;s not unique to
soccer writing, and it&#8217;s certainly not unique to America. Although the
issues are somewhat different in England, <a href="http://twitter.com/lukeymoore">Lukey Moore</a>, one of the
fanatics behind the hilarious, exceptional and smart <a href="http://www.thefootballramble.com/">Football Ramble</a>
podcast, elucidated this view <a href="http://www.toepoke.net/post/2010/04/30/The-Football-Ramble.aspx">in a recent interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a bit of a backlash in the media these days against things
like amateur blogs and podcasts, a lot of journalists think that the
general public&#8217;s opinions are not as valid because they are not
&#8216;proper journalists&#8217;. Doesn&#8217;t really bother me though, I can count on
one hand the number of football journalists I actually&nbsp;respect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s no argument that professional caliber journalists don&#8217;t hold a
monopoly on opinions or incisive commentary. But in one important
regard, they can&#8217;t be beat. Few others have the time, patience or
ability to build relationships with sources in the game that can unlock
difficult stories. That kind of deep reporting can grant them the
authority to ask the unpopular questions that the powers-that-be would
rather&nbsp;ignore.</p>
<h2 id="the-need-for-game-changers">The need for&nbsp;game-changers</h2>
<p>In my little free time, I want to read something about soccer in North
America that: a) I didn&#8217;t know already, b) casts a critical eye on the
sport, and c) comes from someone who is a skeptical spectator,
disinterested in the outcome of any particular&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>There are a few dozen solid reporters on the beat in this country, as
the roster of the <a href="http://www.soccerreporters.com/">North American Soccer Reporters</a> will attest. But
there aren&#8217;t nearly&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>New York Times executive editor Bill Keller&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/books/review/Keller-t.html%20%20">recent review</a>of a
biography of Henry Luce captured a bit of my&nbsp;quandary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;a significant population of serious people feel the need for
someone with training, experience and standards — reporters and
editors — to help them dig up and sort through the news, identify
what’s important and make sense of it. That in no way precludes
enlisting the audience as commentators, as contributors and as
collaborators. (Witness the splendid hybrid of professional and
amateur journalism that has kept alive the stream of news from&nbsp;Iran.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some days, it seems that 99 percent of soccer &#8220;news&#8221; could be classified
as either game transcripts or outright <a href="http://twitter.com/GrantWahl/status/13805381375">boosterism</a>. I read quite a
bit of it, but I also want the news that you can really only get by
chasing it full time, building relationships with players, front office
staff, owners, league employees, coaches and referees over the&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>In the jargon of my industry, I want more of the old media&#8217;s values in
this new media sport: Accountability, speed, skepticism, fearless
questioning of authority. Get it fast and get it right, and when you
don&#8217;t get it right, own up to your mistake and correct it. Without these
kind of mores suffused into our writers, I worry that far too many
important stories are crying out for more reporting. <a href="http://twitter.com/CdnSoccerBlog/status/13805459081">What happened to
Charlie Davies</a> on the night of his accident? What is going on with
<a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/soccer/articles/2010/04/28/revolutions_joseph_in_substance_abuse_program/">Shalrie Joseph&#8217;s life</a> and career? What kind of negotiations went
into crafting Major League Soccer&#8217;s latest labor&nbsp;agreement?</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems there&#8217;s a disconnect between soccer writing and news
journalism. I go to work every day and ask questions of people in power
because I act as a proxy for the regular, taxpaying resident. There is a
presumption that government should be open and accountable. Regardless
of how much we couch it in terms of passion, culture and tradition,
soccer is a business. It&#8217;s becoming a very lucrative business, and it&#8217;s
very closely held. It&#8217;s a private enterprise, and thus there isn&#8217;t that
same moral authority to ask questions and demand answers. But still,
reporters should be using their access, knowledge and insight on behalf
of the average&nbsp;fan.</p>
<p>Someone needs to ask probing questions. We need reporters to help hold
managers and clubs responsible for their mistakes, whether they be poor
tactical decisions at a <span class="caps">US</span> Open Cup match or the financial mismanagement
of an entire club (See: Portsmouth, Leeds, Crystal Palace, Chester City,
<span class="caps">LA</span> Sol, Miami Fusion, etc). We&#8217;re being sold a product, whether it&#8217;s
season tickets or jerseys or television advertising. If we&#8217;re going to
invest our money (not to mention time and energy), it should be worth
our&nbsp;investment.</p>
<div>
[Marie Hardin][], a professor at Penn State&#8217;s [John Curley Center for
Sports Journalism][], [wrote a piece][] in 2007 arguing for a stronger
ethical grounding for sports reporters:

</div>

<blockquote>
<p>One has to wonder what other stories in the public interest (about
systematic problems and corruption in sports, including those at the
prep level) may have also gone unwritten. Although perceived as fun
and games, sports at almost every level in the United States have
become big business with consequences beyond the playing fields.
Sports journalists have an ethical obligation to provide citizens and
consumers with fair and balanced reporting on issues that affect their
communities, their pocketbooks and the health and educations of their&nbsp;children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here in America, we need more reporters walking the soccer beat day in
and day out, particularly in towns that aren&#8217;t so sexy. We need more
people in Kansas City, St. Louis, Salt Lake City and Dallas, for
example. We need more people asking tough questions and competing with
the writers already out there. A competitor breathing down your neck
really helps you kick it into gear and get a better&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>Before we get more writers (which I&#8217;ll discuss in a second part
tomorrow), we need to add the values of professional journalism to the
healthy and established internet community of writers. I&#8217;m not
advocating for a new alliance of bloggers, each sitting in his own
apartment and riffing, linking back and forth. I&#8217;m talking about a
serious, concerted effort to groom, deploy and support soccer&nbsp;writers.</p>
<p><em>Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll discuss how the writers we have can get better and what
we&#8217;ll need to do to get more of&nbsp;them.</em></p>
