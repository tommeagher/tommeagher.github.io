            <p>About six months ago now, I started a new job, taking over as The
Star-Ledger&#8217;s Computer-Assisted Reporting Editor. For anyone who follows
me on Twitter, this may help explain why many of my online comments
lately have dealt with statistics, data visualizations and&nbsp;programming.</p>
<p>In a slight departure from my day-to-day role working with numbers, I
was asked to fill in for one of my bosses at a symposium hosted by John
Jay College&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/centers/media_crime_justice/3411.htm">Center on Media, Crime and Justice</a>. The round table
discussion brought together police and journalists from across New
Jersey to talk about working together and how using social media tools
can help all of us do our&nbsp;jobs.</p>
<p>It was an interesting day to say the least. I sat in a room with 45
cops, reporters and editors who often have an adversarial relationship.
I met cops who my reporters have been interviewing for years, as well as
competitors whose bylines I knew well. It was refreshing to step out of
the daily grind for a few hours and talk about our shared frustrations
and how we can do things better, particularly with the explosion of
social media tools at our&nbsp;fingertips.</p>

<p>After the jump, some of my prepared remarks, without the slight
diversions I took when I delivered them.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2 id="what-the-public-and-the-news-media-want-from-the-police-on-the-internet">What the public and the news media want from the police on the&nbsp;internet</h2>
<p>​1. Speed. Like news organizations and police departments everywhere, we
have seen our resources dwindle. At the same time, competition has grown
exponentially. We want the information fast. We want to know what&#8217;s
happening before it happens and then we want to be able to alert our&nbsp;readers.</p>
<p>It can buy police departments time. If you get a tweet out quickly to
alert the public or confirm or deny an event, then you can avoid calls
from dozens of media outlets hounding you in the short term. It&#8217;ll give
you breathing room to gather the facts on the investigation before
responding to follow-up questions or releasing more details. We know the
scanner chatter is often wrong, but often we can&#8217;t afford not to chase a
story unless the police confirm that it&#8217;s&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>A tweet is a starting point. It can be a great way to immediately alert
a lot of people to a major news issue (a high-profile arrest) or a
public safety or infrastructure concern (tunnel closing, fire or
tornado). But there needs to&nbsp;be&#8230;.</p>
<p>​2. Interaction. The nature of the internet has changed communication.
It is not a one-way platform. For it to have any relevance, you have to&nbsp;interact.</p>
<p>People will come to you looking for answers. if you don&#8217;t provide them,
lots of other people on the internet will try to fill in the gaps, often
with misinformation. A tweet from a passerby that says something like,
&#8220;I drove by a fire on Main St., and it looks like a plane hit a house.
It&#8217;s carnage everywhere.&#8221; could have just been a small kitchen fire that
sent lots of smoke into a residential street. There is no replacement
for an investigation from the&nbsp;authorities.</p>
<p>This will inevitably raise a number of questions in departments large
and small: Who is in charge of the Twitter feed? Who is empowered to
post on it? Is there a policy for replying to tweets or Facebook
comments? It can be time consuming to keep up to date. But a social
media presence isn&#8217;t particularly useful as simply an archive of static
press releases. (As I learned at the event, the [International
Association of Chiefs of Police Center on Social Media][] has drafted <a href="http://www.iacpsocialmedia.org/GettingStarted/PolicyDevelopment.aspx">a
model policy</a> for law enforcement agencies on how to adopt social
media&nbsp;tools).</p>
<p>Being on the internet has to be faster than telling reporters that they
have to wait three days to talk to the designated <span class="caps">PIO</span> about a homicide
(which we hear far more often than one would expect). And posting a
single statement online isn&#8217;t sufficient. It&#8217;s a good place to start so
we know what kind of story we&#8217;re dealing with, but we need to be able to
follow up. We need to be able to ask questions to clarify statements and
probe for more detail. You don&#8217;t have to answer all of the questions,
but we need to be able to ask&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to ever have to attribute information to an agency&#8217;s
website or Twitter feed. We use these as planning tools. Then we want to
confirm the information with a real person in the department to make
sure we got it&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>And the police can use these social media platforms to their
advantage. The <span class="caps">LAPD</span> used Twitter to seek information in a hit and run of
a valet at a restaurant, for instance. They later arrested an elderly
man in the case, although it&#8217;s not clear if the tip that led to his
arrest came from a Twitter&nbsp;user.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/njsp"><span class="caps">NJ</span> State Police</a> has used Twitter to dispel rumors and bad
information from scanner reports about a plane crash in South Jersey or
SEALs training in the Delaware River. They&#8217;ve also used it to get out
initial information on fatal accidents and crimes before being bombarded
by&nbsp;reporters.</p>
<p>​3. The internet is just a tool. If your department or <span class="caps">PIO</span> refuses to
share public information with the public, then there&#8217;s no point in being
online. You have to have information that people want for it to be
worthwhile. Posting about park closures or issues of minor significance
are not good enough. Users on social media, particularly Twitter and
Facebook are voracious news consumers. They want substance and lots of
it. If you&#8217;re not answering phone calls from reporters who need
information, there&#8217;s no reason you&#8217;d do it&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>The benefit of encouraging an air of transparency in your department
however is that it can help demystify the process of police work and
humanize law enforcement&nbsp;officers.</p>
<p>​4. Facebook and Twitter can also be investigative tools. When we
background a subject of a story, a crime or otherwise, these sites are
among the first things we look&nbsp;at.</p>
<p>In several cases in New Jersey lately, it&#8217;s been a key component of
criminal charges against young people. In the <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/09/hold_new_rutgers_post.html">Tyler Clementi case</a>,
his former roommate is charged with trying to doctor his Twitter account
to remove incriminating information. In the case of a group of Old
Bridge teens accused of beating a man to death, they allegedly <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/11/teens_bragged_about_beating_of.html">held
extensive conversations on Facebook</a> about the night in question and
the&nbsp;beating.</p>
<p>And it helps us track people down, like the Hoboken woman who shot <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/05/hoboken_womans_iphone_photos_o.html">the
amazing picture of the Space Shuttle</a> from the window of her airplane.
We found her on&nbsp;Facebook.  </p>
<hr />
<p>My talk went well, although it was a bit disconcerting to notice that
one of my fellow panelists, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MPLASD">Capt. Mike Parker</a> of the Los Angeles
County Sheriff&#8217;s Department, was looking up <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/resume/">my resume</a> on his laptop
as I spoke. Even though I post all these things to the whole world on
the internet, it&#8217;s easy to forget sometimes that anyone actually looks
at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The rest of the day&#8217;s discussions offered a good opportunity to see some
of these sources in a less-heated environment and learn from the other
attendees and panelists (including Ted Gest of <a href="http://reporters.net/cjj/whoweare.html">Criminal Justice
Journalists</a> and Nancy Kolb of the <a href="http://www.theiacp.org/">International Association of
Chiefs of Police</a>) about some of the resources we all have at our
fingertips. I found out about <a href="http://www.thecrimereport.org/">The Crime Report</a>, put together by
Criminal Justice Journalists and The Center on Media, Crime and Justice.
I also heard about <span class="caps">IACP</span>&#8217;s handy directory of <a href="http://www.iacpsocialmedia.org/Directory.aspx">police agencies with a
presence on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Probably the best reminder I heard all day though came from one of the
other panelists, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CaptainJeffPaul">Capt. Jeff Paul</a>, public information officer for the
Morris County Prosecutor&#8217;s Office.  He bristled at receiving calls from
reporters asking for information, in some cases demanding answers,
without ever coming to introduce themselves to&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Even with all of this magic from the interwebs to help us communicate
faster and easier, there really is no replacement for building a
personal relationship, face-to-face, with a police source, before you&#8217;re
on deadline in the middle of a&nbsp;catastrophe.</p>
