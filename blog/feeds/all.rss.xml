&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross-posted from the &lt;a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/10/11/opengov-voices-chasing-the-8-hour-app/" target="_blank"&gt;Sunlight Foundation&amp;#8217;s OpenGov Voices blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, &lt;a title="Hack Jersey" href="http://www.hackjersey.com" target="_blank"&gt;Hack Jersey&lt;/a&gt; brought a group of journalists and developers together to wrestle with campaign finance data. We thought it would be a good opportunity for many to get their hands dirty and to start thinking about new ways of reporting and building with the&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one room of our event at the &lt;a href="http://www.njit.edu/"&gt;New Jersey Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, a group of journalists went on a data expedition, learning how to explore reports from the state&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/09/guiding-journalists-through-strange-world-of-money-and-politics/"&gt;Election Law Enforcement Commission&lt;/a&gt;. In another, we gathered developers to try to build a campaign finance app for New Jersey using the &lt;a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/"&gt;Sunlight Foundation&amp;#8217;s APIs&lt;/a&gt; in a single work&amp;nbsp;session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began Hack Jersey about a year ago, starting with some conversations between journalists and developers who wanted to work together to improve news and data in the Garden State. Since then, with the support of the &lt;a href="http://njnewscommons.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt; News Commons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.mozillaopennews.org/"&gt;Knight-Mozilla OpenNews&lt;/a&gt;, we sponsored the &lt;a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/03/29/opengov-voices-hack-jersey-hackathon-public-data-solving-problems/"&gt;first news-themed hackathon in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and several smaller training&amp;nbsp;events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been eager to take the excitement from the traditional hackathon competition and translate it into projects that news organizations and news consumers can actually use. We wanted our &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/event/law-money-and-politics/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Law, Money &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Politics&amp;#8221; hackday&lt;/a&gt; to entice developers to work together to solve a news problem instead of competing against one another. We were psyched to be able to use Sunlight&amp;#8217;s APIs in that effort and to have the support of the foundation, which helped sponsor our&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was clearly an interest among developers in this approach. About 15 coders&amp;#8212;from computer science programs at local universities, the startup community and nearby news organizations&amp;#8212;came to work, and another four helped us plan the project in our pre-hack&amp;nbsp;meetups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the group took shape, we needed to figure out what we wanted to build. We spent almost four hours over two weeks talking and thinking about ideas we solicited from local news organizations. What problem did we want our app to&amp;nbsp;solve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all agreed that campaign finance is a murky, labyrinthine realm and that people in New Jersey could use all the help they could get understanding it. We love the Sunlight Foundation&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://data.influenceexplorer.com/api"&gt;InfluenceExplorer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; and the way it makes&lt;/a&gt; state data, cleaned and cared for by the &lt;a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/"&gt;National Institute for Money in State Politics&lt;/a&gt;, accessible. We could spend a whole hack day or two trying to mold our state &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELEC&lt;/span&gt; data into a more useful format, but InfluenceExplorer and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIMSP&lt;/span&gt; has done a lot of that dirty work for&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After what we thought was much discussion and tinkering with the &lt;a href="http://tryit.sunlightfoundation.com/influenceexplorer"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we zeroed in on the idea of comparing campaign donations coming from industries into state elections. What industries were backing the most winners in New Jersey? How was campaign spending by industry changing from cycle to cycle? What industries were behind some of our more notable&amp;nbsp;politicians?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-56374  aligncenter" src="http://sunlightfoundation.com/media/2013/10/Hackers-at-Hack-Jersey.png" alt="Hackers at Hack Jersey" width="547" height="392" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hackers at Hack Jersey&amp;#8217;s Law, Money and Politics Hack day. Photo by Tom&amp;nbsp;Meagher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that much decided, our team members volunteered to take certain development roles, and we got ready for the hack day. We imagined a front page with a 30,000-foot-view that would show charts of how much industries have spent on all New Jersey campaigns available in the data, going back more than 10 years. After that, we thought our user could drill in to look at specific industries and how their spending changed from cycle to cycle. Or you could put candidates in specific races side-by-side to see what industries supported&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we quickly realized that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, which offers access to individual campaign donations by state, only really returns requests for top industry spending across the whole nation. There was no method (yet) to let us grab the top industries in just a certain state or a specific&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the day went on, we hit a few more snags when we realized there wasn&amp;#8217;t an easy way through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to get all the candidates who lost elections. So we downloaded the &lt;a href="http://data.influenceexplorer.com/bulk/"&gt;bulk data&lt;/a&gt; from Influence Explorer and pulled those candidates out ourselves. With each unexpected misstep, the minutes and hours flew by. In the hopes of finishing a project, we&amp;#8217;d shrink the scope and tighten our&amp;nbsp;focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally decided, with a couple of hours left, that we could build a demo app that would let you pick an election cycle in New Jersey, and then browse the available races and see what industries supported each candidate. Two of our developers, who also happen to be the leads for our event sponsor Broadstreet Ads, led the final sprint. They helped pull together a Python web.py framework with Angular.js and Highcharts to power the front end. &lt;a href="http://hackjersey.broadstreetads.com" target="_blank"&gt;We could almost see the finish line&lt;/a&gt;. And then we ran out of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to build anything in 8 hours, much less bring 15 people together to make a single, deep and useful news application. Although we fell short, we had fun and learned a lot in the process for how to do it better next&amp;nbsp;time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We could have had a better handle on the very wide range of experience and backgrounds our developers brought to the team. By taking a little more time talking about our skills, we could have focused our project more closely on an attainable goal for such a short window of coding. Time is expensive and in short supply. There is no time for&amp;nbsp;indecision.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Double the time spent planning before the event, and then double it again. Although we did a good job of considering the overall vision and anticipating some of the quirks of the data, we needed to set very specific tasks for everyone on the team and make sure people were clear about their roles and comfortable. A large group doesn&amp;#8217;t always lend itself easily to collaborative exploration or problem solving. People need to feel like they&amp;#8217;re in the mix, especially if they&amp;#8217;re giving up a Saturday for a civic hack&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do more &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank"&gt;pair programming&lt;/a&gt;. With so many developers, we should have put everyone in pairs from the outset, so each person would have a buddy to help spot mistakes and typos that can eat up precious time. We also could have designated experienced developers as leaders for each aspect (back end, front end, design, documentation), who could have helped make some of the design and implementation decisions more&amp;nbsp;quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Read the documentation. Test the methods. It seems so simple, but although we spent a few hours with the Influence Explorer documentation, we still kept finding unexpected nuances in the data it returned, very late in the day. If we had spent more time with it, we could have spotted potential detours more&amp;nbsp;quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an experiment for us. Some experiments don&amp;#8217;t work, but &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/09/developing-a-solution-for-tracking-campaign-giving/%20"&gt;you can learn a lot from failure&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly everyone who participated said they want to work on more news hacking initiatives in the future. Several have said they plan to dig deeper into campaign finance and Sunlight&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in our idea? Take a look at the repo, &lt;a href="https://github.com/hackjersey/politics"&gt;fork it and hack away&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;d love to get others involved, whether you&amp;#8217;re from New Jersey or&amp;nbsp;elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we didn&amp;#8217;t get as far as we would have liked, it was a good experience for us at Hack Jersey. We got 15 developers thinking about campaign finance and starting to learn the ins, the outs and the&amp;nbsp;possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#8217;t grow an orchard in a day, but we planted a lot of good seeds. And that&amp;#8217;s a pretty good place to&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2013 08:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2013-10-19:blog/2013/10/hack-jersey-chases-the-8-hour-app.html</guid></item><item><title>Diving in to Data with SPJ</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2013/04/diving-in-to-data-with-spj.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I had a chance to speak at the Society of Professional

in New Brunswick. &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/debgalant" title="@debgalant on Twitter"&gt;Debbie Galant&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://njnewscommons.org/" title="NJ News Commons"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt; News Commons&lt;/a&gt; and I

&lt;p&gt;A brief detour on the history of data journalism included a data piece
in the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/video/2013/apr/04/history-of-data-journalism-video"&gt;first issue of the Manchester Guardian in 1821&lt;/a&gt; and the cover

conference in San Francisco. I crashed the [#wjchat][] party and ended
up meeting the infamous &lt;a href="http://www.debragalant.com/"&gt;Debbie Galant&lt;/a&gt;, the force of nature behind
&lt;a href="http://www.baristanet.com/"&gt;Baristanet&lt;/a&gt; who was just starting the &lt;a href="http://njnewscommons.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt; News Commons&lt;/a&gt;. We talked
about journalism in Jersey. I floated the idea of a news hackathon, and
she was&amp;nbsp;intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward through a hurricane, an election, months of planning and
promotion, and &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/03/11/rounding-up-our-hack-weekend/"&gt;24 hours of hacking&lt;/a&gt;. I sat in a lecture hall at
Montclair State University listening in awe to 11 teams of journalists
and programmers pitch their projects to change news in New&amp;nbsp;Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Of course, I&amp;#8217;m glossing over many logistical details here. I&amp;#8217;ll just
say that we could not have pulled it off without the generosity and
advice of our &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/sponsors-2/"&gt;sponsors and partners&lt;/a&gt;, especially the News Commons and
&lt;a href="http://www.montclair.edu/arts/school-of-communication-and-media/"&gt;the university&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mozillaopennews.org/"&gt;Knight-Mozilla OpenNews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cartodb.com/"&gt;CartoDB&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/"&gt;O&amp;#8217;Reilly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/"&gt;The Star-Ledger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/"&gt;The Record&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.patch.com/"&gt;Patch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://echolocation.com/"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;
and many&amp;nbsp;others.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe we pulled it off. There&amp;#8217;s no way I could have
imagined in September how much I&amp;#8217;d learn about building community,
blending cultures and sowing the seeds for us to think about news and
data in new ways. Among those&amp;nbsp;lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was a serious miscalculation on my part to try to start at 9 a.m.
    on a Saturday. Neither journalists nor developers are early risers.
    As we waited for folks to drift in, we had to start late and rush
    some of &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/03/11/rounding-up-our-hack-weekend/"&gt;the presentations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the biggest challenges was trying to manage people&amp;#8217;s
    expectations of what they&amp;#8217;d get out of giving up a weekend to stare
    at a computer screen on a college campus. Some people wanted to
    learn to code. Others wanted nerds to help them with their next big
    project. A few, I imagine, wanted to network for a job. We wanted
    everyone to feel like she or he could be a part of this experience
    and could offer something, no matter previous experience or skill
    level. For some newsroom denizens whose only exposure to developers
    was their much maligned &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; staff, this was a revolutionary idea.
    They have been trained to treat technologists like a deli counter:
    Order up whatever newfangled internet thing you need and wait for it
    to show up. My hope was at the end of the hackathon, our reporters
    and developers could start to imagine how they can work together. I
    think on that front we&amp;nbsp;succeeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We may have overloaded the schedule with speakers, and our talks
    were geared too heavily toward journalists. Some of the participants
    would have liked more discussion of the process of creating news
    apps rather than the concepts of data journalism and news app
    thinking. Others wanted less yakking and more&amp;nbsp;hacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s just as important for us to bring programmers to the news world
    as it is to introduce journalists to the development process. We
    succeeded on the latter, but we need to do more for the former. We
    could have used speakers from the tech world who would have lured
    more&amp;nbsp;programmers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish we had more diversity in &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/speakers/"&gt;our roster of speakers&lt;/a&gt;. I was
    thrilled to have Emily Bell as &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/judges/"&gt;one of our judges&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of
    the folks on our planning committee were women, as were many of our
    participants. But I think we erred in not having more women
    presenters, giving a false impression of the state of news
    development and the programming world as a&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We just didn&amp;#8217;t have enough developers. We needed to have more than
    one on each team, preferably someone with backend skills and someone
    else with frontend skills. Some of the teams had one developer and
    four journalists. That just didn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found some teams didn&amp;#8217;t need more than one or two journalists,
    even those with significant computer-assisted reporting skills. Some
    of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt; veterans had a hard time translating their expertise in
    analyzing data to the idea of developing a reusable&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To my surprise, many of the programmers were not really familiar
    &lt;a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/2013/03/learning-to-commit-to-version-control/"&gt;with version control or git&lt;/a&gt;. Only Sunday morning, as the
    deadline loomed, did some teams ask about how to use Github, leaving
    me to run around and teach people. Some teams also didn&amp;#8217;t have
    server space to host a demo site, something I assumed was a given. A
    suggestion from judge and mentor Jonathan Soo was to have us offer
    hosted server space for the teams and to require everyone to push an
    initial commit to Github within the first hour of&amp;nbsp;hacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The teams with strong projects at the end either came with an idea
    or settled on one very quickly. We need a mechanism for teams to
    find members and for people to think about data and project ideas
    ahead of time. Some teams spent far too much time arguing over ideas
    or failed to really evaluate the data they were hoping to use.
    Suggestions were made for a pre-networking event a week before or a
    forum or email list for people to talk ahead of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I realized far too late that &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt; was good for displaying
    details on the event planning, but &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/blog-2/"&gt;the blog&lt;/a&gt; was completely
    unusable. The commenting system didn&amp;#8217;t work at all. Next time, we
    need to test that earlier or set up a functional blog at&amp;nbsp;blog.hackjersey.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of &lt;a href="https://github.com/hackjersey"&gt;our 11 projects&lt;/a&gt;, three teams didn&amp;#8217;t finish enough to present
    anything beyond what they learned from not finishing. Another four
    teams had very rough demos, but had proofs of concept to show. So
    &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/01/28/and-the-winners-are/"&gt;four teams finished&lt;/a&gt; pretty much functional&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to build a strong community, the best way to start is by
    recruiting a broad coalition of journalists, developers, designers,
    hackers, educators, nonprofits and bureaucrats to help plan the
    event. Thanks in large part to Debbie Galant, we had more than 20
    people on our organizing committee, and their ideas and dedication
    made this hackathon&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I considered our first Hack Jersey event a success. And that
leads us to think about what&amp;#8217;s next. We have a few&amp;nbsp;ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing sponsorship from the New Jersey News Commons and the
    School of Communication and Media at Montclair State&amp;nbsp;University.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hack day aimed at scraping a poorly structured public dataset that
    could be hosted for all to use&amp;nbsp;freely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming training, perhaps through a partnership with other
    groups who have already invented that&amp;nbsp;wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic data reporting training, which many working journalists say
    they are hungry&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solicit ideas for newsroom tools from news organizations large and
    small. Take that list of use cases and host a hack day or series of
    hack days to build open source&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think &lt;a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/"&gt;Hack Jersey&lt;/a&gt; should work on next? What
would be most useful to you as a journalist? If you&amp;#8217;re a developer, what
kind of projects would you be interested in working on with us? I&amp;#8217;d love
to hear your ideas. Please share them in the comments, or email us at&amp;nbsp;hackinfo(at)hackjersey(dot)com.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2013 11:08:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2013-04-04:blog/2013/04/organizing-my-first-hackathon.html</guid></item><item><title>Learning to commit to version control</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2013/03/learning-to-commit-to-version-control.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;At this week&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar-2013/"&gt;computer-assisted reporting conference&lt;/a&gt; in Louisville,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRE&lt;/span&gt; has me doing double-duty. In addition to my class on &lt;a href="bit.ly/car13refine"&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/a&gt;,
I&amp;#8217;m also teaching a hands-on session on &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumes you&amp;#8217;ve already &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git"&gt;downloaded git&lt;/a&gt; and created an account on
Github. I use the command line, although if you master that, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;
clients will be a piece of&amp;nbsp;cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve somehow, inadvertently become a bit of a Git evangelist, not out of
any mastery, but mostly because of my convert&amp;#8217;s zeal for version
control.  And the one-two punch of git and Github have changed the way I
think about my job, web development and sharing knowledge. Here&amp;#8217;s a
quick run-through of the class. If you&amp;#8217;re a visual learner, the slides
are here: &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/car13gitslides"&gt;http://bit.ly/car13gitslides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-git"&gt;What is&amp;nbsp;git?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control_system"&gt;distributed version control system&lt;/a&gt; (If this doesn&amp;#8217;t mean
    anything to you, don&amp;#8217;t sweat it. It&amp;#8217;s mostly for the&amp;nbsp;nerds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a command line utility to track changes to a file and to share those
    changes with&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good for any kind of text - stories, csv, html, .js, .py,&amp;nbsp;.rb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not so great with images, audio,&amp;nbsp;video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-git-do"&gt;What does git&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;In a broad
oversimplification, it uses &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff"&gt;diff&lt;/a&gt; to compare every addition and
subtraction in your code and shows you how your files&amp;nbsp;evolve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lets you take snapshots of your code and roll through them over time
(or back in time) as needed to follow how a file changes from save to
save to save. And you can have several authors of a file branch off
their own versions to edit and then later merge them all back together
into one master&amp;nbsp;file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.clasesdeperiodismo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Newsdiff-mubarak.png" title="Newsdiff" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-does-it-work"&gt;How does it&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a lot of things going on behind the curtain in git, that you can
figure out eventually, but don&amp;#8217;t worry about it here. For right now,
basically you only need to really know six&amp;nbsp;commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to know&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will orient you to where you are, what files have changed and
whether you&amp;#8217;ve saved your snapshot of your project (which we&amp;#8217;ll soon
start calling a &amp;#8220;commit&amp;#8221;). This is your&amp;nbsp;friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you work and where you edit your code is the working directory.
When you&amp;#8217;re ready to take a snapshot of your code, you &amp;#8220;add&amp;#8221; your file
to the staging&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://codingdomain.com/git/partial-commits/git-staging-area.png" title="Git diagram" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;#8217;ve made all the changes you want, and you&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8220;added&amp;#8221; all of
your updated files to the staging area, it&amp;#8217;s time to make a commit. And
with each commit, you want to add a short message describing what the
changes&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;commit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;finally debugged my own idiocy. maybe...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now all of your updates are saved in your file respository, and if you
want to, you can your snapshot is made. You could very easily stop here
and just keep the audit trail on your machine. But the other half of
this happy marriage is &lt;a href="http://www.github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What is&amp;nbsp;Github?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo-transparent.png" title="Github" /&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;Github
is a social coding site, and it&amp;#8217;s a hosted remote repository.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;It
lets you back up all of your code online (for free if it&amp;#8217;s open source),
and it lets you see how other developers do it and learn from their&amp;nbsp;work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s
how you do&amp;nbsp;it: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"&gt;You
&amp;#8220;push&amp;#8221; your code from the &amp;#8220;master&amp;#8221; branch that&amp;#8217;s on your machine to your
remote repository on Github, which we call &amp;#8220;origin.&amp;#8221; (This may have
already been configured for you if you cloned your repo from github.
Otherwise, you would have&amp;nbsp;to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tommeagher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;myrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many great things about Github is that you can see the diff
in your files without the Matrix hypnosis of command&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last couple commands I&amp;#8217;ll tell you are how you get your commits from
the remote repository on Github back on your&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;nbsp;use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;to gather the updated files from your remote &amp;#8220;origin&amp;#8221; repository. Now
you want to &amp;#8220;merge&amp;#8221; the changes from the master branch on your remote
&amp;#8220;origin&amp;#8221; repository into your master branch on your&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now your files are updated from the remote repository. Now keep&amp;nbsp;coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more, you can visit the &lt;a href="http://www.github.com/tommeagher/gitintro"&gt;repo for this class&lt;/a&gt;, where I
have a cheat sheet for the most common basic uses and commands and more
in-depth&amp;nbsp;tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really just deals with the basics. We haven&amp;#8217;t even had a chance to
talk about &lt;a href="http://githowto.com/resolving_conflicts"&gt;merge problems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://gitref.org/branching/"&gt;branching&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo"&gt;forking&lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/ch03.html"&gt;cloning&lt;/a&gt;,
but you know how to Google, so you can figure it out. Fork my repo,
improve the cheat sheet and send me a pull&amp;nbsp;request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s your favorite tip or cheat in git? Leave me a comment. I&amp;#8217;d love

Louisville, I am once again teaching a course on using &lt;a href="http://openrefine.org/"&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/a&gt; to
clean data. Although the program has changed names over the last few
months, its features are pretty much the same, and it&amp;#8217;s still an
amazingly powerful and free tool for cleaning and standardizing
difficult data. If you ever find yourself frustrated with typos,
misspellings or any number of other mistakes in the data you get from
government agencies, OpenRefine will change your&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t repeat verbatim my Refine tutorial, &lt;a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/2012/06/clean-data-is-the-best-weapon-against-the-planet-of-the-apes/"&gt;which you can find here&lt;/a&gt;,
but I will share some of the resources again and point you to a few
other&amp;nbsp;tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, check out the updated &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/car13refineslides"&gt;slides for my class&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;d like to
follow along with the class, you can download our data for the &lt;a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lotterywinners.csv"&gt;lottery
winners&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nj-hospital-2012.xls"&gt;hospital report cards&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nassau_police_union_contribs.xls"&gt;campaign finance
data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re just looking for a good cheat sheet of Refine&amp;#8217;s key functions,
&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/car13refinecheats"&gt;try this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought my class was easy, and you&amp;#8217;re looking for more help with
Refine, I can recommend these tutorials, from Refine creator &lt;a href="http://davidhuynh.net/spaces/nicar2011/tutorial.pdf"&gt;David
Huynh&lt;/a&gt;, developer &lt;a href="http://dannguyen.github.com/NICAR-Google-Refine/"&gt;Dan Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; and journalism educator &lt;a href="http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/07/05/cleaning-data-using-google-refine-a-quick-guide/"&gt;Paul

evening, I took the Amtrak train home to New Jersey, feeling good about
turning a group of journalists on to the power and fun of incorporating
data into their&amp;nbsp;reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The next morning, the horrible shooting at Newtown Elementary School
threw our world upside-down. Only now, more than two months later, have
I been able to take a moment to revisit the rough notes and links I
dumped here in December to try to make them a little more&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first class was an overview discussion of &amp;#8220;data journalism&amp;#8221; and the
many and sundry techniques that encompasses. The second class was a
hands-on walk-through of Excel and Google Fusion Tables. The handouts
and cheatsheets cover nearly all of the tips we discussed. If you have
questions, or would like to know more, please leave a comment or send me
an&amp;nbsp;email.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s do something fun and map the data for a story, using Google&amp;#8217;s
experimental (and free) &lt;a href="http://tables.googlelabs.com/"&gt;Fusion Tables&lt;/a&gt; program. We&amp;#8217;re going to
download a spreadsheet in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; format of the violent crime rates for
every town in&amp;nbsp;Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://www.datahaven.org"&gt;DataHaven.org&lt;/a&gt; Go to indicators&gt;Public safety&gt;Community
safety&gt;Violent crimes&gt; total violent crime rate&lt;br /&gt;
Select all towns and hit the submit button. Click &amp;#8220;All years&amp;#8221; and hit
submit again. Now you can download the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;, which stands for
comma-separated values. It&amp;#8217;s essentially a spreadsheet without any of
the fancy highlighting or formatting of Excel. It&amp;#8217;s a universal format,
and when given the option, it&amp;#8217;s a good idea to get your data in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;.
Because of its simple structure, it&amp;#8217;s easy for a human to read and just
about any computer can understand&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have our data, but if we want to visualize it, we need a map to
put it on. We can get this map from a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHP&lt;/span&gt; (pronounced &amp;#8220;shape&amp;#8221;) file.
 Luckily, in many states, the government or academic institutions often
have a clearing house for this kind of geographic data. In Connecticut,
you can find it at the U. Conn. library. Point your browser toward
&lt;a href="http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/"&gt;http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/&lt;/a&gt;, then look under the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GIS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; column and
click on the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/connecticut_data.html#boundaries"&gt;Boundaries&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;nbsp;section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab the &amp;#8220;Connecticut Towns&amp;#8221; shapefile from 2010. Then you have to
convert the file to a format that Fusion Tables can use. Luckily, there
is a free website called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://shpescape.com/"&gt;Shp Escape&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; that can help. Give it your
shp file and log into your Google account and it will automatically
transform the file and ship it into your Fusion Tables account. Some
times the site can be a little busy, so it may take a few minutes. Be&amp;nbsp;patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that you have your map file in Fusion Tables, you need the data you
want to visualize. Go to Google Drive, click the &amp;#8220;create&amp;#8221; button and
choose Fusion Table. Choose the &amp;#8220;download.csv&amp;#8221; file that you got from
Data Haven and put this into your Fusion Table. (Notice, Fusion Tables
also allows you to import tabular data directly from a Google&amp;nbsp;Spreadsheeet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean up the column headings in the file to make the more meaningful.
Now we&amp;#8217;re going to merge the data file back to the shape file we already
uploaded. Under the &amp;#8220;File&amp;#8221; dropdown menu, choose &amp;#8220;Merge.&amp;#8221; Find your
Connecticut Towns shape table. And you have to determine which field to
join the tables on. What field is the same in both tables? Notice that
the &amp;#8220;town&amp;#8221; field in the crime table matches the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAME10&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; field in the
shape file. That&amp;#8217;s your key to join the tables together. Just be certain
that each town name only appears once in that column in each table (in
this example, it&amp;nbsp;does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it sends you into Fusion Tables, click the &amp;#8220;About this table&amp;#8221; link
under the File dropdown menu and &amp;#8220;edit table information.&amp;#8221; Update the
name of the table, give it a meaningful description, attribution and a
link to the original download. This can help you later to retrace your
steps and bulletproof your reporting. It will also help others who look
at your work and want to see your primary source material. Click on the
&amp;#8220;Share&amp;#8221; button and make the map&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have both tables combined together into one, new, merged table. But
if you click on the &amp;#8220;Map&amp;#8221; tab, it probably still doesn&amp;#8217;t look right. We
need to style the representation of the data. While you&amp;#8217;re on the map
tab, go to the &amp;#8220;Tools&amp;#8221; dropdown and click on &amp;#8220;Change Map Styles.&amp;#8221; This
will allow us to choose how we want to color code the towns based on
their crime rate. Instead of points, we want to click on &amp;#8220;Fill color&amp;#8221;
under the &amp;#8220;Polygons&amp;#8221; section. Points would be if we were color-coding
pins on individual addresses. Instead, we want to shade an entire town
based on its crime rate, thus we want &amp;#8220;polygon.&amp;#8221; For the fill color,
let&amp;#8217;s pick the &amp;#8220;buckets&amp;#8221; tab, which means we can choose four different
colors to represent the range of crime rates in our area. If you want to
fancy, you can choose whatever color you want for each bucket. Hit the
&amp;#8220;save&amp;#8221; button. Are all of your towns filled in with a color? (You can
ignore the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm"&gt;Southwick Jog&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;). If not, then you probably haven&amp;#8217;t set
the range of values for your crime rate to the include all of them.
Adjust the high and low ends of your range until none of your towns are
blank. This may take some&amp;nbsp;jiggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play with the bucket sizes and colors of the buckets. What makes sense?
Is everything in&amp;nbsp;there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the title to change the attribution and background info for the
merged table. Share the merged table and make it public. Then click
Tools&gt; Publish. This gives you the embed code for you to put it in your&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get the hang of this, you can but producing web-ready
interactive maps in 20-30 minutes, a task that would have taken hours or
days not all that long ago. This is an awesome&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="500" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=MAP&amp;amp;q=select+col0%3E%3E1+from+1hJY9IspBzWrEx5csZTISYn_r4JKlbTBIlGZyyyI&amp;amp;h=false&amp;amp;lat=41.620240308269935&amp;amp;lng=-72.47735563281253&amp;amp;z=8&amp;amp;t=1&amp;amp;l=col0%3E%3E1&amp;amp;y=2&amp;amp;tmplt=2"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few more things that you can tweak, if you like. You can go
to Tools&gt;Change info window layout, to tweak the information that&amp;#8217;s
displayed when you click on a&amp;nbsp;polygon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one last tip, you don&amp;#8217;t always have to upload your own data or map
files. You can go to Help&gt;Search Public Tables and browse through all
of the data that other Fusion Tables users have uploaded. Of course, as
with all reporting, the caveat is to mindful of the source. Always
confirm the information and data with other parties. But if you find a
good shapefile, you could use it again and again. It&amp;#8217;s definitely worth&amp;nbsp;exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the super fast and dirty introduction to Fusion Tables. Now, go
explore it some more on your own. What&amp;#8217;s your favorite trick in Fusion
Tables? Drop me an email, leave a comment or mention me on Twitter and
I&amp;#8217;ll add it&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;

spreadsheet from a government agency and being told by a spokesman that
the data (say, a table of property tax rates in municipalities that was
clearly created in Excel) only exists in a locked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of expediency, you sometimes just have to bite the bullet
and try to wrestle the data free from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s clutches so that you can
gently guide it into a more useful&amp;nbsp;spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not always easy, but here are a few resources to do just&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Nguyen at &lt;a href="http://www.propublica.org/"&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt; crafted this very helpful and comprehensive
&lt;a href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/turning-pdfs-to-text-doc-dollars-guide"&gt;guide to the various strategies for unlocking data from PDFs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also had some success using &lt;a href="http://www.cometdocs.com/"&gt;CometDocs&lt;/a&gt;, a free site that had a
surprisingly high accuracy rate for converting documents on one
particularly labor-intensive&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not afraid of installing a simple command line program, I&amp;#8217;ve
also had some luck with PDF2text. Here&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href="http://www.ire.org/resourcecenter/nettour/PDFTOTEXT.pdf"&gt;nice tutorial from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(looks like the link may be temporarily broken), as well as a guide to
how to &lt;a href="http://ire.org/blog/on-the-road/2010/09/01/quick-fix-to-tame-pdfs/"&gt;automate the conversions&lt;/a&gt; and not be bothered by the pesky
command&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve heard good things about the commercial software &lt;a href="http://www.docudesk.com/deskunpdf_product_home.shtml"&gt;DeskUnPDF&lt;/a&gt;, but
I haven&amp;#8217;t had an opportunity to use it&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;#8217;t have the time or patience to negotiate with an agency to
give you what you want how you want it, give these solutions a&amp;nbsp;try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have other techniques for culling data from PDFs, please share&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good&amp;nbsp;luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2012 06:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2012-08-05:blog/2012/08/pdfs.html</guid></item><item><title>How to get a head count at the parade</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2012/07/crowd-estimates.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is another in the series of &amp;#8220;Best Practices&amp;#8221; posts from my
archives from the Herald News. This was also written by &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2008/02/maslow-mourned/"&gt;Jonathan
Maslow&lt;/a&gt;, and offers some solid street reporting tips for counting the
crowd at any large public event.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News reporting often involves telling how many people took part in or
attended an event. Sometimes the seating capacity is known, as in the
case of a sports stadium. Sometimes an official estimates the crowd
size, sometimes the organizers estimate. Sometimes they don&amp;#8217;t agree.
Sometimes no one&amp;nbsp;estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a good practice for the reporter to do his or her own estimation in
all&amp;nbsp;cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For inside events, a quick head count with a qualifying &amp;#8220;about&amp;#8221; is good.
(&amp;#8220;about 75 people attended the planning board session.&amp;#8221;) The tried and
true method of estimating crowd size is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
1) make a careful measurement of the area in which the event takes
place. Simply put, that&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;length times width equals square feet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
In some cases, it may take a slightly more sophisticated algorithm (the
crowd covers the sidewalks on six blocks. Ask officials how long each
block is, walk off the width of sidewalk.&amp;nbsp;Multiply).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2) Decide whether it&amp;#8217;s a dense crowd or a loose crowd. People packed
into a subway car, for example, are a dense crowd and occupy 2 square
feet per person. A loose crowd, such as a parade of journalists on May
Day, has one person per five square&amp;nbsp;feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3) Divide the area by the crowd density, and you&amp;#8217;ve got your estimated
crowd.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: A political rally takes place in the square outside City Hall.
You pace it off and find it&amp;#8217;s 150 feet long and 100 feet wide, or 15,000
square feet. You wade into the crowd to test the density. Some places
toward the front are packed, but in the back it&amp;#8217;s loose. You choose a
density in between of one person per three square feet. Divide 15,000 by
3 = 5,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To&amp;nbsp;recap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;area: 150 x 100 = 15,000&lt;br /&gt;
 estimate of density: 3 sq. feet/per person&lt;br /&gt;
 15,000 divided by 3 = 5,000&amp;nbsp;attendees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; is covering an event, check your estimate against theirs, which is
based on aerial/satellite photography and should be accurate. If yours
and theirs are at great odds, dig in your heels and insist the wire
services are an&amp;nbsp;ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: [Then] Passaic County Sherriff&amp;#8217;s communications man Bill Maer says
the county uses a slight&amp;nbsp;variation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1) Count how many people are actually in a 10 x 10 foot area (that&amp;#8217;s
100 square&amp;nbsp;feet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2) Measure on foot or get a good estimate of the size of the entire&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3) divide the total area by 100 (the number of 10 by 10&amp;nbsp;squares)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4) Multiply the result by how many people are in the sample 10 x 10
foot&amp;nbsp;square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think this adds an unnecessary step, but it does make the
reckoning of density a bit more accurate and hence, perhaps, the crowd
estimate&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;

get the same kind of credit for their work that other reporters receive.
I suppose it&amp;#8217;s understandable, if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NICAR&lt;/span&gt;-L is any indication, because to
some of our colleagues data work is a mysterious and opaque contribution
to a story and thus they don&amp;#8217;t quite know how or when to give us a&amp;nbsp;byline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the policy we used when I was the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt; reporter at the Herald
News, and it was heavily modeled (in some parts verbatim) on the one
adopted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gebeloffnyt/"&gt;Rob Gebeloff&lt;/a&gt;, then of The Star-Ledger and now at the New
York Times. This slightly updated policy also guides us today at The
Star-Ledger as we decide when our work merits a byline. It&amp;#8217;s a good
place for newsrooms to start the conversation about the work of their
data&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data journalist is available every day for assistance, large and
    small, on daily, breaking and enterprise stories. The reporter is
    here to help locate data. When another reporter or editor asks for a
    quick fact here or there (such as a basic Census figure), no credit
    is necessary. It’s part of the&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many times, the quick fact search turns into an analysis of data.
    When this analysis produces “proprietary information” that supports
    a story, the data journalist should receive a tagline on the story.
    For example, a colleague wants a complete breakdown of Census data
    for a particular neighborhood—a task that would require the reporter
    to assemble the data piecemeal from several tables or sources—this
    would create proprietary information unique to our news gathering.
    If this information is even just a few paragraphs of the story, a
    tagline is&amp;nbsp;appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the data journalist does a significant analysis of data that
    creates proprietary information that becomes the thesis of a story,
    he or she will receive a byline.&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even if the data journalist
    does not write another word in the published piece, his or her
    reporting forms the basis of a story and thus warrants a
    byline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
   For example, the journalist analyzes a new set of data released by a
    government agency and finds that homeowners in suburban Passaic
    County are scooping up flood insurance hand over fist. The reporter
    assembles the analyzed data and passes it on to the real estate
    reporter who finds additional sources for quotes and writes the
    story. The nut graf of the story should say “a Herald News analysis
    of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TK&lt;/span&gt; data has found…” and the data journalist shares the byline
    with the other&amp;nbsp;reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

starts to feel like we may be suffering from post-polls&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTSD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year and a half, we&amp;#8217;ve been experimenting at The
Star-Ledger with ways to improve how we report election results online
and in print. In many elections, we&amp;#8217;ll have hundreds of races spread
across a dozen counties. And none of the officials overseeing those
elections provides a useful electronic feed of&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve tried off-the-shelf products to input election data into tables
with disastrous, near-comical results. Without a single developer in our
newsroom, we&amp;#8217;ve cobbled together solutions and written hundreds of lines
of code to reverse engineer our hand-collected data and take it from our
website into our print pagination system. For something that&amp;#8217;s over in
just a few hours, we invest an incredible amount of time and effort into
getting it right, often without being really satisfied with the&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that struggle has led us here, to our proposal for the Knight
Foundation&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.newschallenge.org"&gt;News Innovation Challenge&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href="http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25541612650/voter-the-versatile-online-tabulator-for-election"&gt;project we&amp;#8217;re calling
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VOTER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VOTER&lt;/span&gt; is a browser-based program that will help organizations streamline
the collection of election results and create embeddable online graphics
that will work on any website, especially the common blogging platforms
that power many news operations. It is still very early in the
development process, but we&amp;#8217;re excited about the News Challenge and even
more psyched about the possibility that we can turn our trauma into
something that will save newsrooms everywhere a whole lot of&amp;nbsp;heartache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? We&amp;#8217;d love to hear your experiences, both good and
bad, from the election nights you&amp;#8217;ve covered. What&amp;#8217;s worked for you to
get results online and what hasn&amp;#8217;t? Leave a comment here or &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/ultracasual"&gt;tweet at
me&lt;/a&gt;. And, most importantly, tell us what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VOTER&lt;/span&gt; will need to do to make
it useful for your&amp;nbsp;organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jun 2012 23:14:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2012-06-30:blog/2012/06/waking-from-the-election-results-nightmare.html</guid></item><item><title>Bolstering transparency in our reporting</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2012/06/transparency.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back at the Herald News, several of the editors and reporters wrote a
regular series of columns for the newsroom called &amp;#8220;Best Practices.&amp;#8221; In
digging through my archives, I&amp;#8217;ve found several that are timeless that I
will gradually repost. This first one was written by &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2008/02/maslow-mourned/"&gt;Jonathan
Maslow&lt;/a&gt;, and his tips for being transparent in our reporting and
writing continue to ring&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our credibility as journalists and as a newspaper is the most important
equity we have in the marketplace of ideas. The more readers trust us,
the better our performance. We have to earn that trust every single day.
One of the most important ways to do this is leveling with our readers:
telling them what we know, how we know it, what we don&amp;#8217;t know, why we
don&amp;#8217;t know it and what&amp;#8217;s what. In practice this entails the highest
degree of transparency possible in our publication.Work toward greater&amp;nbsp;transparency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1) Don&amp;#8217;t use hearsay. Don&amp;#8217;t describe things you didn&amp;#8217;t see, but rather
attribute it to a firsthand witness and tell the reader who that witness
was. If you are writing about a public meeting you did not attend, be
aware that readers must not be given a false impression. You don&amp;#8217;t need
to say you weren&amp;#8217;t there. But you can&amp;#8217;t report things as if you were&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2) Don&amp;#8217;t just use the boilerplate &amp;#8220;sources said,&amp;#8221; but give the reader
as much information as you can without breaching trust, for example:
&amp;#8220;two sources in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s office familiar with the case,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;a high
official in the department who asked her name not be used because she
feared political&amp;nbsp;retribution.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3) Don&amp;#8217;t just use the cliche &amp;#8220;the mayor could not be reached for
comment.&amp;#8221; Use instead: &amp;#8220;the mayor did not return repeated phone calls
for comment over a three-day period, although City Hall said he was not
on vacation or out of town on&amp;nbsp;business.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4) As you know, we sometimes have problems getting information from
police on weekends. Don&amp;#8217;t just let this go with &amp;#8220;police did not release
information.&amp;#8221; Tell the readers, e.g., &amp;#8220;Sgt. Troy Anthony said he could
not release any information about the incident, because Mayor Sammy
Torres, who is also acting public safety director, has told the police
department that all news releases must go through his office. The mayor
did not return five phone calls&amp;nbsp;Sunday.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency is a habit, a muscle. Flex it and it gets stronger. And
your work gets more accurate, better, more useful to&amp;nbsp;readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
You&amp;#8217;re faced with a dilemma that&amp;#8217;s fairly common in many&amp;nbsp;newsrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say, for example, a series of accidents kills a number of children
crossing busy streets near you. Now, you want to know the deadliest
roads or intersections in your area (this is not the dilemma, just wait
for it). &lt;img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f0bvyZMrZ9k/TTjrIgdvMaI/AAAAAAAAGFE/UppLYR8YaJw/s1600/barney-fife.jpg" title="Barney Fife" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
We always say in the news business to check it out, and we shouldn&amp;#8217;t
trust anecdote and the frailty of human memory.  So where do you go?

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Does this guy, right, look like he has an encyclopedic knowledge
of every fatal accident in your five-county &lt;/span&gt;coverage area?

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
File a public records request and get the data. It should have the
answer you need, right? You pick up your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; with the data, or if you&amp;#8217;re
really lucky, the state police will have a file you can download from
their website. You expect to get a tidy Excel spreadsheet with very
orderly numbers on it. Everything will be geocoded, and you&amp;#8217;ll just need
to do one quick pivot table or one quick group-by query and drop it into
[Fusion Tables][] and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt;! you&amp;#8217;re done with your story. It writes
itself, right?

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.cartoonstock.com/newscartoons/cartoonists/mbc/lowres/mbcn1960l.jpg" title="Google Earth for Pirates" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You laugh, but this is what I spent years believing, and every time I
was&amp;#8212;and continue to be&amp;#8212;flabbergasted by the sloppiness of the public
data I get my hands&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I worked on the dangerous intersections story, I got something that
looked like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="refine" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/refine.jpg" title="refine" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
(This is a dramatization)

As David Donald said in his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt; panel yesterday, cleaning is the longest
and hardest part of the data process. Assume any data you get is dirty
and full of holes.

Government data is hardly unique in this respect, but it is our bread
and butter, and frankly we should expect better from the government, so
I&amp;#8217;ll pick on it today.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wzxhzdk64why-is-so-much-public-data-such-a-messwzxhzdk65"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is so much public data such a&amp;nbsp;mess?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
​1. Much like journalists, government agencies are not nearly as good
with numbers as they ought to&amp;nbsp;be.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;2. When databases exist, they are often built on things never
intended to be turned into relational data, like hand-written accident
reports.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;3. Many agencies seem to subscribe to the[infinite monkey
theorem][].&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
![][2]

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
For anyone unfamiliar with it, the infinite monkey theorem more or less
says that given an infinite amount of time and an infinite number of
monkeys with typewriters, eventually the monkeys will write the complete
works of Shakespeare or &amp;#8220;A Tale of Two Cities.&amp;#8221;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;When you work with a lot of public data, this is what feels like.
Occasionally there&amp;#8217;s something correct, but before you find it, you have
to wade through what seems like a near-infinite number of errors.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; I&amp;#8217;m not suggesting that government employees are
primates, but I am pretty certain that they&amp;#8217;re outsourcing their data
entry to monkeys&amp;#8230; and it gets worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Because these monkeys are not&amp;nbsp;geniuses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="http://images.wikia.com/planetoftheapes/images/a/a3/Zaius_1.jpg" title="Dr. Zaius" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
They are enemies of good data.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://pwwwblog.ibeatyou.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/the-wizard-of-oz-monkey-2.jpg" title="Flying monkey with the Wicked Witch of the West" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
These monkeys are mean, and they hate puppies and clean data (and
water). To be fair, in my completely unscientific survey, the data has
gotten better in the past decade, but it&amp;#8217;s not where it should be.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
Every data entry mistake possible will be made. Often you fill find new
mistakes that you never, ever would have considered or imagined in your
wildest dreams.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;These clerical errors will make your life miserable. You can
either welcome our new monkey overlords or you can arm yourself.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-old-tools"&gt;The old&amp;nbsp;tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
-   Excel: filters, pivot tables, string functions
-   Access: Group by queries
-   Notepad++: Regular expressions
-   Scripting language for automated, repetitive cleaning

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
With these, the cleaning of the database could take days or weeks or
longer.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
Now you can do it with Google Refine in a few hours or less.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Google-refine-logo.svg/631px-Google-refine-logo.svg.png" title="Google Refine" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
It can take that crap and turn it into a diamond.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-is-refine-good-at"&gt;What is Refine good&amp;nbsp;at?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
- Transforming data, either on individual cells or whole columns at a
time

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
- Clustering data to find similar values that repeat for exploration and
cleaning

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;- And many, many other tasks.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refine does a lot of really amazing things, and this class will give you
just a tiny taste. It can help high-level programmers with repetitive
tasks, and it has its own expression language for accessing and
scrubbing data. But it is also a great tool for the less technical set.
If you&amp;#8217;re comfortable with Microsoft Excel, you should be right at home
with Refine. You don&amp;#8217;t have to be a comp sci PhD to love&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
The two big areas we&amp;#8217;re going to concentrate on today are clustering
data and transforming it

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#8217;s get started. Here are instructions&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/InstallationInstructions"&gt;to install Refine&lt;/a&gt; on your&amp;nbsp;computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll start with a dataset of lottery winners from New Jersey. Say you
want to know what areas spend the most on lottery tickets but win the&amp;nbsp;least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lotterywinners.csv"&gt;the lottery dataset here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refine runs through your web browser, but don&amp;#8217;t worry, it works offline
as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can import a table file in many formats, either from your computer,
from Google Docs or from a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; for a file on the web. Once you have
Refine running, click &amp;#8220;Create&amp;nbsp;Project.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll see a preview of what the data looks like. When you pull in the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; of lottery data, make sure to uncheck the &amp;#8220;Parse cell data&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="importcsv" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/importcsv.jpg" title="importcsv" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
New Jersey zip codes start with zero. If Refine guesses that column is a
number, it will drop the leading zero, so unchecking the option will
preserve the zips as text.

With this data, we&amp;#8217;re going to use Refine to clean up the W\_TOWN column
to standardize the names of municipalities. But we never want to work
with the raw data, so let&amp;#8217;s copy the column that we&amp;#8217;ll actually
transform into something usable. So click on the arrow at the top of the
W\_TOWN column and choose the Edit Column\&gt;Add column based on this
column option.

Enter a name for the new column. We&amp;#8217;ll use &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOWN&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221; Original, I know.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="copycolumn" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/copycolumn.jpg" title="copycolumn" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Now, initially Refine will only display 10 rows, but there are 3,100 in
this dataset, so let&amp;#8217;s look at a for more. Click the number 50 next to
&amp;#8220;Show as&amp;#8221; to see more.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
In Excel, one of the first things you&amp;#8217;d do with a dataset is sort it. So
click on the arrow at the top of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOWN&lt;/span&gt; column and choose &amp;#8220;Sort&amp;#8221; from
the options. Now,  you can filter out just a few records. Click on the
arrow and choose &amp;#8220;Text Filter&amp;#8221; from the options. You&amp;#8217;ll see a box pop up
in the left column. Type in Atlantic and see how it plucks out only the
towns with &amp;#8220;Atlantic&amp;#8221; in the name: Atlantic City, Atlantic Highlands,
Atlantic High and West Atlantic City. As you might guess, not all of
these are real towns.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Let&amp;#8217;s lose the filter. Click on the X in the upper left corner of the
filter box. Now, we&amp;#8217;re going to add a Facet\&gt; Text facet. Dan Nguyen
at ProPublica calls Refine&amp;#8217;s faceting &amp;#8220;the better way to filter.&amp;#8221; He&amp;#8217;s
totally right.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
The facet will create a box in the left column with the total number of
choices and a list of all the possible choices in this column and the
number of each. You&amp;#8217;ll see there are 608 options. At the top is
&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABERDEEN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; with 3 occurrences. Scroll to the bottom and click on &amp;#8220;Facet
by choice counts.&amp;#8221; This will create another box that will let you
display only the choices that occur a certain number of times. It shows
the range of values in a column and helps you to spot anomalies or
outliers. For instance, if you move the boundaries to only show the
choices with between 120 and 140 uses, you&amp;#8217;ll only see &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JERSEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CITY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; and
&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEWARK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; rows. Close the &amp;#8220;Facet by choice counts&amp;#8221; box.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Scroll through the text facet box a little ways into the Bs. See the
option for &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BELEE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MEAD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;? It has one occurrence. Notice that two lines
later appears &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BELLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MEAD&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;#8221; the actual name of the town. If you hover
over &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BELEE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MEAD&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;#8221; you will see the option to &amp;#8220;edit&amp;#8221; appear to the
right. Click on that and then fix the spelling of the name in the box
that appears. Notice that the choice count drops to 607.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="facet" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/facet.jpg" title="facet" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Let&amp;#8217;s look at another way to clean data. Scroll down a few more lines.
Notice that there are two lines in a row for &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BERKELEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HEIGHTS&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221; They&amp;#8217;re
spelled the same, so why are they listed separately? Because one of them
has an extra space at the end of it that screws up the grouping. This is
the kind of thing that back in the bad old days would make you throw
your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; out the window two weeks into a data project. Instead, let&amp;#8217;s get
rid of all the extra, invisible spaces. Click at the top of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOWN&lt;/span&gt;
column, edit cells\&gt; common transforms\&gt; Trim leading and trailing
whitespace. Notice again how the choice count dropped. We&amp;#8217;re down to 573
town names now. We&amp;#8217;re getting there.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
So you could spend hours scrolling through and eyeballing similar names
and editing them by hand using these methods, or we could unleash the
real power of Refine: clustering.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Click on the &amp;#8220;Cluster&amp;#8221; button in the facet box. Click it and you&amp;#8217;ll see
something like this. The default method is &amp;#8220;key collision.&amp;#8221; That should
only show a couple of options. Try changing it to &amp;#8220;nearest neighbor.&amp;#8221; I
can&amp;#8217;t exactly explain the algorithm behind it, but it&amp;#8217;s obvious that it
finds town names with similar names that should probably have the same
name. You see similar sets like &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POMPTON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAKES&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POMPTON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAKE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; or
&amp;#8220;E. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ORANGE&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;E &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ORANGE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;E.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ORANGE&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221; Click the &amp;#8220;merge&amp;#8221; button next to
each grouping and type the name you want them all to be changed to in
the &amp;#8220;New Cell Value&amp;#8221; column and hit the &amp;#8220;Merge selected and recluster&amp;#8221;
button at the bottom. You&amp;#8217;ve just cleaned those messy columns to a
single value.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
![cluster][]

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scroll through the list, reclustering and editing whole chunks at a
time. This is a huge time saver. When you&amp;#8217;re done with the &amp;#8220;nearest
neighbor&amp;#8221; clusters, experiment with &amp;#8220;key collision&amp;#8221; and see if it picks
up any other similar&amp;nbsp;names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, keep in mind that to get this right, you&amp;#8217;ll have to do some
additional reporting. You&amp;#8217;ll need to be certain that &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NORTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRUNSWICK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;
and &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPRTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRUNSWICK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; are indeed the same place and not separate values
as they came to you. If you&amp;#8217;re confident in your reporting, Refine makes
the data cleaning&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re satisfied that you&amp;#8217;re done, click on &amp;#8220;Export&amp;#8221; on the upper
right corner. You can output the file as html, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSV&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;, Excel or any
number of formats. Pull it into your favorite spreadsheet program and
run your analysis. Then run it all again to make sure you got it right.
To be certain, start from scratch and triple-check&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
As cool as this is, Refine has a few more tricks for the beginner. Let&amp;#8217;s
look at this file of [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt; hospital report cards][].

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Create a new project and import it into Refine.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Anything look weird? How about that first column. Seems like it includes
information we&amp;#8217;d probably want to split into several columns. In Excel
you&amp;#8217;d do this with a series of nested functions. In Refine, we can do it
with a single click. At the top of the &amp;#8220;Hospital&amp;#8221; column, choose the
drop-down menu and Edit column\&gt;Split into several columns&amp;#8230;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
When the wizard menu pops up, choose  a semicolon as the separator and
uncheck &amp;#8220;remove this column,&amp;#8221; because we always want to be compare
against our original data, right?

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="splitcolumns" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/splitcolumns.jpg" title="splitcolumns" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
So this looks better, with the name, street, town, state and zip code in
separate columns. But something isn&amp;#8217;t quite right. What about the zip
code? Why is it only four digits? Oh yeah, New Jersey zip codes start
with zeroes. Refine assumed that column was an integer and lopped off
the zero at the front.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Another great feature of Refine is that it logs everything you do with
the dataset. When you make a mistake or you want track back through your
work, click on the &amp;#8220;Undo/Redo&amp;#8221; tab at the top of the left column and you
can tiptoe back through your process.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Look at the list and click on the item at the top, &amp;#8220;0. Create project&amp;#8221;
to jump back to that step.

![undo][]

Now, redo the &amp;#8220;Split into several columns&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; step and this time uncheck
&amp;#8220;Guess cell type&amp;#8221; to preserve the zips as text.

Be sure to make note of the undo option at the top of the screen. You
can move a single step back at any time by clicking on this, much like
the undo prompt that appears in Gmail after you archive or delete a
message.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Finally, notice that the names of the hospital are inconsistent. Some
are all uppercase. Others are only upper-cased. Let&amp;#8217;s standardize them.

Click on the arrow at the top of the Hospital column and choose Edit
cells\&gt; Common transforms \&gt; To titlecase.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="titlecase" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/titlecase.jpg" title="titlecase" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voila. A cleaned dataset. You&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s try one last dataset, this one looking at contributions from
&lt;a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nassau_police_union_contribs.xls"&gt;Nassau County, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;N.Y.&lt;/span&gt; police unions&lt;/a&gt; to political&amp;nbsp;candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Import the data into Refine and let&amp;#8217;s start by trying to clean up the
town&amp;nbsp;names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a text facet to the City column. Click Edit cells&gt; Common
transforms&gt; trim leading and trailing&amp;nbsp;whitespace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
See the count change from 240 to 238.

Now, let&amp;#8217;s cluster the city names to see if we can consolidate any
entries.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="copcluster" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/copcluster.jpg" title="copcluster" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
How do you see the count change in the city column?

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Now, let&amp;#8217;s turn our attention to the Name column. For this exercise,
let&amp;#8217;s start by adding a filter on the city and just looking at &amp;#8220;Albany.&amp;#8221;
You can also do this by clicking on Albany in the text facet box.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Keep in mind  that any changes we make from here on out will only affect
the &amp;#8220;Albany&amp;#8221; subset of the data until we clear this filter (or facet).
Now, add a text facet to the &amp;#8220;Name&amp;#8221; column. Browse the first few
entries. Notice there are a lot of very, very similar names here.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
For the sake of argument, let&amp;#8217;s say we&amp;#8217;re interested in looking at how
much Sen. Joe Bruno got from Nassau police groups. There appear to be 10
groups here with similar names receiving donations for Bruno. Seems like
a good chance that many of these are the same organization. For the sake
of argument, let&amp;#8217;s say your reporting shows that yes, these are the same
group and we want them to all have the same name for our analysis. Hover
your cursor over each one and when the option to &amp;#8220;include&amp;#8221; appears on
the right, click it. Once you&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8220;included&amp;#8221; them all, click the cluster
button.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="subfacet" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/subfacet.jpg" title="subfacet" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
This will attempt to cluster the choices just in this selection to offer
suggestions on names that could b the same. Change the method to
&amp;#8220;nearest neighbor&amp;#8221; and the distance function to &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPM&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221; If you merge all
of the offered suggestions under the same name, it will condense six of
the 10 choices into one name. Then you can merge and re-cluster. Once
you clean up all the suggestions, you can browse the data in the facet
one last time and clean up any stragglers individually as needed.
Believe it or not, Refine has just saved you a massive amount of time
and energy.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-did-we-learn-here-today"&gt;What did we learn here&amp;nbsp;today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Refine is a huge time saver and allows you to do commonly tedious data
cleaning tasks with a few clicks of the mouse. We saw how to:  
- Import and export data.  
- Copy and edit columns, trimming whitespaces or changing the
capitalization.  
- Use facets to filter and edit data  
- Cluster a column to standardize spellings and&amp;nbsp;entries.

&lt;/p&gt;
This has been a whirlwind sprint through this program, but hopefully
it&amp;#8217;s given you a taste of what it can do.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
In an ideal world, we&amp;#8217;d get all of our data handed to us perfectly clean
in easy to access, user-friendly, real time feeds that make for simple
analysis and display.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
But until then, we&amp;#8217;re going to have to wrestle with the murky and messy
datasets produced by those infinite monkeys making an infinite number of
mistakes. Use Refine as your new big gun and never give up the fight.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember, if you let the monkeys who enter data into government
spreadsheets win, this is where it will&amp;nbsp;lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/toddessig/files/2011/08/planetoftheapesending.jpg" title="Spoiler alert" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#8217;ll make a monkey out of you too.

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Finally, if you want to keep messing with Refine, here are a pair of
tutorials that put it much better than I can.

&lt;/div&gt;

fantastic checklist suggestions offered by David Donald at the &lt;a href="http://www.ire.org/blog/2012-ire-conference-blog/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRE&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8216;12
conference&lt;/a&gt; in&amp;nbsp;Boston.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like surgeons, journalists who work with data can always use help
ensuring they&amp;#8217;re getting things right. I compiled this checklist of
questions I ask myself whenever I work with a data set. It&amp;#8217;s evolved
into a tool that The Star-Ledger data team uses on every story we&amp;nbsp;write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did the data come&amp;nbsp;from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who created it? Is this the best source for this data? What was
    the methodology behind its&amp;nbsp;collection?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What documentation came with&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you read the&amp;nbsp;documentation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a record layout or data&amp;nbsp;dictionary?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you save an original copy of the database if you need to
    retrace your&amp;nbsp;steps?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are your field headings accurate? Do you have the columns labeled&amp;nbsp;correctly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you looking at the correct tab? Is there additional data in
    other tabs in the&amp;nbsp;worksheet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many records are in your table or database? How many should be
    there? Are there any missing? Too many? Any chance you maxed out
    the number of fields the software can&amp;nbsp;handle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there duplicates in the&amp;nbsp;records?*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine each column of data one at a time. Is it formatted in the
    appropriate manner? Are there any gaps in the column? Are any data&amp;nbsp;missing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have names and entities been cleaned and&amp;nbsp;standardized?*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the aggregation. How was it&amp;nbsp;done?*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When joining tables, are you certain the join worked? How many
    records are there now? Too many? Not&amp;nbsp;enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When pasting tables with common columns side-by-side in Excel, do
    they line up? Any chance two records might be&amp;nbsp;switched?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What calculation are you trying to do? Are you using the
    appropriate formula or function for this&amp;nbsp;task?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do your cell/column references in functions point to the right
    places? Are any columns transposed? Can you trace the formula&amp;#8217;s
    path? Have you pasted the correct formula all the way down the
    column to the bottom of the&amp;nbsp;table?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When sorting, did you sort the entire table together and not omit
    any&amp;nbsp;columns?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When pasting, is it a good idea to Paste Special&gt;Values to strip
    out any pesky underlying formulas that may become&amp;nbsp;misdirected?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When moving columns, were there any \$ anchors that you pasted
    that now point to the wrong column or row of data and throw off
    your&amp;nbsp;calculations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your calculation make&amp;nbsp;sense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you looking at outliers or values in the middle of the&amp;nbsp;pack?*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there an expert&amp;#8212;either an agency data guru or academic&amp;#8212;who
    has vetted your process or&amp;nbsp;calculations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you verified your records against the original records or a
    sample&amp;nbsp;thereof?*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you spot-checked individual records to ensure the numbers
    match up? Did you ask a colleague to assist by reading off numbers
    to be&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CQ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;d?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you asked an uninvolved colleague to look at your process,
    review the numbers and poke holes in the&amp;nbsp;methodology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you reproduce your calculations from the beginning or explain
    step-by-step how you arrived at your&amp;nbsp;conclusion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What numbers are you using in the story? Have you circled them and
    reviewed them in the database? Is the description of the numbers
    accurate? Does it omit any pertinent details that might mislead an
    unwary&amp;nbsp;reader?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the numbers here based on counting, estimates, projections or&amp;nbsp;guesses?*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any graphics with the story? Have you checked them? Can
    you verify every number? Are the introduction and column heads
    accurate? Are there numbers missing from the graphic that are
    important to the&amp;nbsp;story?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a methodology/nerd box to run with the&amp;nbsp;story?*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you get here, and does it make&amp;nbsp;sense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you bulletproof your data work? At the 2012 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NICAR&lt;/span&gt; conference in
St. Louis, Tom Johnson and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cephillips"&gt;Cheryl Phillips&lt;/a&gt; led a seminar discussing

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not even going to try to compete with Matt Doig&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://motherjones.tumblr.com/post/4046557808/the-best-journalism-job-want-ad-ever-ever"&gt;hilarious&lt;/a&gt; and

very good place to&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve got great journalists here who make a habit of exposing the
mind-boggling arrogance, greed, incompetence and corruption of the
Garden State&amp;#8217;s public officials. One of our colleagues just &lt;a href="http://amyellisnutt.com/"&gt;won a
Pulitzer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt; in feature writing for her investigation of the
sinking of a small fishing vessel that killed six men&lt;/span&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re led
by top-notch editors who care about writing and about watchdog
journalism that gets results.  My (relatively) new team is starting to
do some cool work, and we have an ambitious agenda for the year&amp;nbsp;ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking for strong candidates &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;soon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Please pass this along to
anyone you think might be qualified. Here&amp;#8217;s the job&amp;nbsp;description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Star-Ledger is looking for a journalist to fill an entry-level
position on its computer-assisted reporting team. The reporter will be
responsible for acquiring and analyzing public records and data to
support enterprise stories for print and online. He or she should be
comfortable filing public records and freedom of information requests
with agencies at the local, state and federal levels. The reporter
will also contribute to the redesign and maintenance of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt; By The
Numbers, our home for databases and statistics vital to New Jersey&amp;nbsp;readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifications: A background in local or investigative reporting for a
daily news outlet and an affinity for math, web development and
programming. Ability to identify and mine public databases for
stories large and small and to build and manage relational databases.
Experience displaying data graphically in print and online to engage&amp;nbsp;readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proficiency with Microsoft Excel and Access, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESRI&lt;/span&gt;
ArcView and Google Maps. Bonus points for candidates who have
experience or interest in scraping, scripting, frameworks (Django,
Rails, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;.Net) or statistical analysis with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPSS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAS&lt;/span&gt; or&amp;nbsp;R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested, send me a cover letter, resume and clips to my

Star-Ledger&amp;#8217;s Computer-Assisted Reporting Editor. For anyone who follows
me on Twitter, this may help explain why many of my online comments
lately have dealt with statistics, data visualizations and&amp;nbsp;programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a slight departure from my day-to-day role working with numbers, I
was asked to fill in for one of my bosses at a symposium hosted by John
Jay College&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/centers/media_crime_justice/3411.htm"&gt;Center on Media, Crime and Justice&lt;/a&gt;. The round table
discussion brought together police and journalists from across New
Jersey to talk about working together and how using social media tools
can help all of us do our&amp;nbsp;jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting day to say the least. I sat in a room with 45
cops, reporters and editors who often have an adversarial relationship.
I met cops who my reporters have been interviewing for years, as well as
competitors whose bylines I knew well. It was refreshing to step out of
the daily grind for a few hours and talk about our shared frustrations
and how we can do things better, particularly with the explosion of
social media tools at our&amp;nbsp;fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the jump, some of my prepared remarks, without the slight
diversions I took when I delivered them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-the-public-and-the-news-media-want-from-the-police-on-the-internet"&gt;What the public and the news media want from the police on the&amp;nbsp;internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Speed. Like news organizations and police departments everywhere, we
have seen our resources dwindle. At the same time, competition has grown
exponentially. We want the information fast. We want to know what&amp;#8217;s
happening before it happens and then we want to be able to alert our&amp;nbsp;readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can buy police departments time. If you get a tweet out quickly to
alert the public or confirm or deny an event, then you can avoid calls
from dozens of media outlets hounding you in the short term. It&amp;#8217;ll give
you breathing room to gather the facts on the investigation before
responding to follow-up questions or releasing more details. We know the
scanner chatter is often wrong, but often we can&amp;#8217;t afford not to chase a
story unless the police confirm that it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tweet is a starting point. It can be a great way to immediately alert
a lot of people to a major news issue (a high-profile arrest) or a
public safety or infrastructure concern (tunnel closing, fire or
tornado). But there needs to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Interaction. The nature of the internet has changed communication.
It is not a one-way platform. For it to have any relevance, you have to&amp;nbsp;interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will come to you looking for answers. if you don&amp;#8217;t provide them,
lots of other people on the internet will try to fill in the gaps, often
with misinformation. A tweet from a passerby that says something like,
&amp;#8220;I drove by a fire on Main St., and it looks like a plane hit a house.
It&amp;#8217;s carnage everywhere.&amp;#8221; could have just been a small kitchen fire that
sent lots of smoke into a residential street. There is no replacement
for an investigation from the&amp;nbsp;authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will inevitably raise a number of questions in departments large
and small: Who is in charge of the Twitter feed? Who is empowered to
post on it? Is there a policy for replying to tweets or Facebook
comments? It can be time consuming to keep up to date. But a social
media presence isn&amp;#8217;t particularly useful as simply an archive of static
press releases. (As I learned at the event, the [International
Association of Chiefs of Police Center on Social Media][] has drafted &lt;a href="http://www.iacpsocialmedia.org/GettingStarted/PolicyDevelopment.aspx"&gt;a
model policy&lt;/a&gt; for law enforcement agencies on how to adopt social
media&amp;nbsp;tools).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on the internet has to be faster than telling reporters that they
have to wait three days to talk to the designated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIO&lt;/span&gt; about a homicide
(which we hear far more often than one would expect). And posting a
single statement online isn&amp;#8217;t sufficient. It&amp;#8217;s a good place to start so
we know what kind of story we&amp;#8217;re dealing with, but we need to be able to
follow up. We need to be able to ask questions to clarify statements and
probe for more detail. You don&amp;#8217;t have to answer all of the questions,
but we need to be able to ask&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t want to ever have to attribute information to an agency&amp;#8217;s
website or Twitter feed. We use these as planning tools. Then we want to
confirm the information with a real person in the department to make
sure we got it&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the police can use these social media platforms to their
advantage. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAPD&lt;/span&gt; used Twitter to seek information in a hit and run of
a valet at a restaurant, for instance. They later arrested an elderly
man in the case, although it&amp;#8217;s not clear if the tip that led to his
arrest came from a Twitter&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/njsp"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt; State Police&lt;/a&gt; has used Twitter to dispel rumors and bad
information from scanner reports about a plane crash in South Jersey or
SEALs training in the Delaware River. They&amp;#8217;ve also used it to get out
initial information on fatal accidents and crimes before being bombarded
by&amp;nbsp;reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. The internet is just a tool. If your department or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIO&lt;/span&gt; refuses to
share public information with the public, then there&amp;#8217;s no point in being
online. You have to have information that people want for it to be
worthwhile. Posting about park closures or issues of minor significance
are not good enough. Users on social media, particularly Twitter and
Facebook are voracious news consumers. They want substance and lots of
it. If you&amp;#8217;re not answering phone calls from reporters who need
information, there&amp;#8217;s no reason you&amp;#8217;d do it&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of encouraging an air of transparency in your department
however is that it can help demystify the process of police work and
humanize law enforcement&amp;nbsp;officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Facebook and Twitter can also be investigative tools. When we
background a subject of a story, a crime or otherwise, these sites are
among the first things we look&amp;nbsp;at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several cases in New Jersey lately, it&amp;#8217;s been a key component of
criminal charges against young people. In the &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/09/hold_new_rutgers_post.html"&gt;Tyler Clementi case&lt;/a&gt;,
his former roommate is charged with trying to doctor his Twitter account
to remove incriminating information. In the case of a group of Old
Bridge teens accused of beating a man to death, they allegedly &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/11/teens_bragged_about_beating_of.html"&gt;held
extensive conversations on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; about the night in question and
the&amp;nbsp;beating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it helps us track people down, like the Hoboken woman who shot &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/05/hoboken_womans_iphone_photos_o.html"&gt;the
amazing picture of the Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; from the window of her airplane.
We found her on&amp;nbsp;Facebook.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk went well, although it was a bit disconcerting to notice that
one of my fellow panelists, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MPLASD"&gt;Capt. Mike Parker&lt;/a&gt; of the Los Angeles
County Sheriff&amp;#8217;s Department, was looking up &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/resume/"&gt;my resume&lt;/a&gt; on his laptop
as I spoke. Even though I post all these things to the whole world on
the internet, it&amp;#8217;s easy to forget sometimes that anyone actually looks
at&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day&amp;#8217;s discussions offered a good opportunity to see some
of these sources in a less-heated environment and learn from the other
attendees and panelists (including Ted Gest of &lt;a href="http://reporters.net/cjj/whoweare.html"&gt;Criminal Justice
Journalists&lt;/a&gt; and Nancy Kolb of the &lt;a href="http://www.theiacp.org/"&gt;International Association of
Chiefs of Police&lt;/a&gt;) about some of the resources we all have at our
fingertips. I found out about &lt;a href="http://www.thecrimereport.org/"&gt;The Crime Report&lt;/a&gt;, put together by
Criminal Justice Journalists and The Center on Media, Crime and Justice.
I also heard about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IACP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s handy directory of &lt;a href="http://www.iacpsocialmedia.org/Directory.aspx"&gt;police agencies with a
presence on social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the best reminder I heard all day though came from one of the
other panelists, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CaptainJeffPaul"&gt;Capt. Jeff Paul&lt;/a&gt;, public information officer for the
Morris County Prosecutor&amp;#8217;s Office.  He bristled at receiving calls from
reporters asking for information, in some cases demanding answers,
without ever coming to introduce themselves to&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all of this magic from the interwebs to help us communicate
faster and easier, there really is no replacement for building a
personal relationship, face-to-face, with a police source, before you&amp;#8217;re
on deadline in the middle of a&amp;nbsp;catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leave a comment below or follow me on Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/ultracasual/" title="Tweet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@ultracasual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;and
tell me about your experience working with police or journalists on
social media&amp;nbsp;networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[International Association of Chiefs of Police Center on Social
  Media]:&amp;nbsp;http://www.iacpsocialmedia.org/&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2011 11:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2011-05-20:blog/2011/05/cops-and-social-media.html</guid></item><item><title>HIPAA</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2010/10/hipaa.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Since the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act&amp;#8217;s privacy
rule went into effect in 2003, it has become increasingly difficult for
journalists to get information about the health care and treatment of
individuals. My former colleague, health reporter Betsy Querna,
recommends the &lt;a href="http://www.healthjournalism.org/"&gt;Association of Health Care Journalists&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; primer on the
federal&amp;nbsp;law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;there are a number of public policy exceptions under the Privacy
Rule that permit the disclosure of protected health information
without an individual’s authorization. For example, covered entities
may disclose information for treatment purposes, for certain law
enforcement or public health oversight purposes, or in accordance with
a court order. (This list is not&amp;nbsp;exhaustive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the following are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; protected health information:
police and fire incident reports, and court records. Also, birth
records and autopsy records are not protected health information to
the extent they are maintained by state agencies. In addition, if a
state &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOIA&lt;/span&gt; law designates death records and/or autopsy reports as
public information that must be disclosed, covered entities may
disclose that protected health information without an&amp;nbsp;authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitals may maintain directories of patients, although patients can
ask to be kept out of the directory and health care professionals use
their professional judgment with regard to what directory information
(if any) to include about incapacitated individuals. &lt;strong&gt;When someone
calls and asks about a patient by name whose information is in the
directory, the hospital may reveal where the patient is located in the
hospital and information about the patient’s general condition
(including whether the patient has died, or whether the patient has
been treated and released)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To release additional information to a reporter, a hospital must
obtain written authorization from the patient (or the patient’s parent
or guardian in the case of minors). That document does not have to be
notarized or witnessed.&lt;/strong&gt; The American Hospital Association’s Web
site, &lt;a href="http://www.aha.org"&gt;http://www.aha.org&lt;/a&gt;, provides a checklist of what should be
included in an authorization form, along with other guidance on&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIPAA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Write tight. Maybe the most important thing you can do to increase
your productivity without doing more work is to write tight and trim
your own work. Write briefs instead of 8 inchers. Write 8 inchers
instead of 10 inchers. Write 10-12s instead of 12-15s. Write 12-15s
instead of 15-18s. The tighter you write, the less time it takes and the
more time you free up for other stuff. Time is a gift to the news
reporter. Use that extra hour or half hour to stop in on your beat, talk
to a couple sources on the phone, read online what other newspapers are
doing, or skim-read documents or&amp;nbsp;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Prewrite/outline. Whether you sweat over your copy or it flows from
your fingers like hot fudge, prewriting saves you time and energy. Take
five to 10 minutes before you start to think how am I going to handle my
story. Look at your notes and materials. Make yourself a thumbnail
outline. What&amp;#8217;s your lede? What&amp;#8217;s your best quote(s)? What&amp;#8217;s the news
important to readers? What&amp;#8217;s the background? What&amp;#8217;s the context? Once
you&amp;#8217;ve got a bijou outline, you&amp;#8217;ve got a roadmap. Drive, she&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Demand coaching. Editors know they need to story conference and
coach writing and help with resources and ideas, but things get hectic
and sometimes they don&amp;#8217;t. That does not mean you should not ask advice
and coaching. The crucial times to talk to an editor are: before you
start reporting; after you finish reporting, but before you start
writing; when you&amp;#8217;ve got a top; and, of course, when you have to make a
late decision on whether the story holds up, reaching an alternate
source,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.Master the art of the weekbook. It can&amp;#8217;t be said too often or
emphasized too much: the weekbook is the key to excellent and efficient
performance. At its basic level, the weekbook is a scheduling device. To
take your weekbook to a higher level of value requires the additional
ingredient: forethought. Here are several specific practices that can
improve your weekbook - as well as your editors&amp;#8217; esteem and your job&amp;nbsp;satisfaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a good mix of stories every week. No one wants to do the same
    thing day after day. Build concise dailies around news events,
    meetings, issues. Build in patches (centerpieces) by thinking what
    will make a good photo story. Build a weekend story every week by
    giving yourself a couple hours early to midweek to report, a day or
    three quarters day midweek to late week to write. Build in
    overnights with a 2 p.m. deadline, freeing up an afternoon for
    weekend story or enterprise work. Put in a strong daily Monday to
    anchor the week and a timeless news feature, profile or human
    interest story later in the week, that can be used on the&amp;nbsp;weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News stories break like waves. It&amp;#8217;s coming (preview), it breaks&lt;br /&gt;
    (hard news) and recedes (impact, folo, news feature, analysis,
    preview of&lt;br /&gt;
    next stage). Think of that wave shape. Ride the wave and you&amp;#8217;ll get
    three or more hits off one news&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a line called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOLO&lt;/span&gt; beneath every budget line in your weekbook.
    After you&amp;#8217;ve finished your story, go back and give yourself leads to
    follow up: sources not reached, questions unanswered on deadline,
    possible profiles of people in the news, impact of an event, stories
    that ask why? And how? instead of just who, what, where and when.
    Readers&amp;#8217; surveys often indicate that one of the things readers
    dislike is hit and miss coverage, especially one day wonders.
    Readers want closure. They want the rest of the story. Use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOLO&lt;/span&gt;
    line to help fill your next&amp;nbsp;weekbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your weekbook a living document. Go back and change it, add to
    it, as the week goes along. It only takes a minute. Then re-mine
    that weekbook in subsequent&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know you are going to be working on a weekend, start talking
    to your weekend editor about your story early in the week. There&amp;#8217;s
    nothing more awful than a reporter in panic on Thursday afternoon
    with no idea what to cover on Saturday or&amp;nbsp;Sunday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Team up with colleagues. It&amp;#8217;s challenging, it&amp;#8217;s fun, it&amp;#8217;s
productive. And&lt;br /&gt;
it gives readers from various towns some sense of how news cuts across&lt;br /&gt;
municipal&amp;nbsp;boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Keep a tickler file, aka a futures file; fill it with clips,
letters,&lt;br /&gt;
notes, pictures, labels and related junk of every variety from which
story&lt;br /&gt;
ideas will emerge. Review it now and&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​6. Don&amp;#8217;t fall into the rut of thinking there are no good stories on
your&lt;br /&gt;
beat. Instead, try to attack same-old stories from different,
imaginative&lt;br /&gt;
angles. Write more stories on how news impacts our towns and people.
Write local trend stories. Write community crime trend stories. Write
service pieces that inform readers about things they never thought they
wanted to know and help readers make decisions. Write local business
pieces. Write local environmental stories. Write more people stories,
and especially more profiles. People like to read about people. Put a
human face on as many stories as you possibly&amp;nbsp;can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​7. Remember &lt;a href="/third/"&gt;listening posts&lt;/a&gt; for increasing the diversity of our
sources and scope? Start doing them one day per period, as required. If
you can&amp;#8217;t do a full day, spend a few hours one day and a few hours
another day. Add new sources to your regular news coverage. Add new
voices to the mix of sources. The Herald News should never become a
city/town hall&amp;nbsp;newspaper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​8. We can do the short-term investigation. We can do investigations
that depend more on human intelligence than massive data analysis. We
can reveal sides of life in our coverage area that no one knows. Try to
rethink your investigative ambitions. Go for the clean, short, effective
strike. Go for the Wow! Factor: the story that makes readers say to
themselves, &amp;#8220;Wow, I didn&amp;#8217;t know&amp;nbsp;that!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​9. Revisit stories. Many reporters know to keep a futures file. Many&lt;br /&gt;
know to revisit certain stories on a temporal basis (after one year,
five&lt;br /&gt;
years, 10 years etc.). This best practice adds another revisit
category: the revisit to the incomplete story. Sometimes, try as we
might, we simply cannot get the full story by deadline time. Typically,
an important source is missing or evasive. Or an agency delays an
answer. Or a document can&amp;#8217;t be obtained. There are many forms of this.
We go with what we&amp;#8217;ve got. But when there&amp;#8217;s a significant hole in the
article, we owe it to readers to revisit the story as soon as we can and
follow up with a second story or brief. This is especially true when the
missing information changes the way we covered the story previously.
This best practice speaks to both accuracy and thoroughness- two
important parts of getting it right, which is our basic contract with&amp;nbsp;readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​10. Morgue. Many of you are checking the digital library for articles&lt;br /&gt;
going back for years (to 1998) as part of your routine reporting. All
of&lt;br /&gt;
you should be doing this every day. In addition, however, please don&amp;#8217;t&lt;br /&gt;
forget that the library has a paper morgue going back donkey years.
It&amp;#8217;s a&lt;br /&gt;
good practice to check this, particularly when articles involve people
who&lt;br /&gt;
don&amp;#8217;t show up in the digital. Ask Mauro Margarelli to help you find
the&lt;br /&gt;
files you&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​11. Eight Ways to Tell a Story. One of the most useful handouts Warren&lt;br /&gt;
Watson of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; left behind is the one put together by the York Daily
Record editor about the local kid who won a dance contest. She wrote the
same story in eight different ways, from inverted period to Q&amp;amp;A, to
photo package, blocks, narrative and beyond. This is a handy document
that all should have and refer to. If you don&amp;#8217;t have it, see Jonathan
for a copy. If you do have it, use it. God did not hand down the
inverted pyramid on stone tablets. Many stories can be told better in
other ways. Just as no one likes to eat the exact same thing three times
a day, readers, too, want variety. You can still present serious news
information in entertaining ways. It just takes thought, creativity and
effort. The reporter&amp;#8217;s job is always to make what she finds relevant
interesting for the&amp;nbsp;reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-story-forms"&gt;New story&amp;nbsp;forms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Three &lt;strong&gt;Narrative Dailies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrative journalism is often associated, in journalists&amp;#8217; minds, with&lt;br /&gt;
lengthy enterprise projects. But there is no law saying narrative
techniques cannot be used in dailies or short form. At the recent
Niemann Narrative Conference at Harvard, I jotted down three types of
daily stories that we could start doing to tell stories in new,
interesting and insightful ways for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HN&lt;/span&gt; readers. Below, three generic
budget lines. Use them in good health, with one caveat: narrative
doesn&amp;#8217;t mean you can make it&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TICKTOCK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take a news event, breaking or second day reporting. Instead of&lt;br /&gt;
organizing from the most important in the lead to the least important
at the end, we reconstruct the event over time. What led up to that
explosion? What happened the night that cop was murdered? What did that
family do on the day they died in a car crash? Exactly what steps did
the mayor take that allowed him to pass a zero increase budget? Or,
alternatively, what is the aftermath of a particular news event? What
happened minute by minute after the plane crashed? What happened to the
freeholder in the days and weeks after he dropped out of third&amp;nbsp;grade?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SECONDDRAFT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalism is often called the first draft of history. But the first
draft&lt;br /&gt;
is often abbreviated and cursory, sometimes underreported or skewed,
and in some cases, wrong. In this story type, we take a second look at a
breaking story, going back to sources for a fuller or better account,
taking an unexpected angle or digging out some universal human truth
from what at first ran as a brief or rushed deadline piece. The goal is
truth, not just&amp;nbsp;facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXPLAINER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrative methods focusing on one person can often help readers
understand complex, novel or unfamiliar issues and processes better than
conventional reporting - which often overlooks the explanatory.
Bankruptcy. Identity theft. Outsourcing. Uninsured. Poverty level.
Daycare. Drug addiction. Productivity. Deregulation. Bond rating. And on
and on. In the explainer, we use one person&amp;#8217;s story to give readers
insight into a hard-to-get-at&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Three types of &lt;strong&gt;profiles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of profiles, if we think of them at all, as one thing:&lt;br /&gt;
stories about people. It took Bill Blundell, former Page One editor at
the&lt;br /&gt;
Wall Street Journal has three types of&amp;nbsp;profiles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​a. The General Profile: Concentrates on unique qualities of subject,&lt;br /&gt;
aspects of difference: what makes this person unique, different,&lt;br /&gt;
outstanding, unusual, unconventional, nontraditional, nonstandard,
peculiar, pale and&amp;nbsp;interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​b. The Microcosm Profile: centers on aspects of sameness,
universality.&lt;br /&gt;
In what ways is this person or this person&amp;#8217;s story typical, universal,&lt;br /&gt;
human, like all of us? What part of her or her story can we all
connect&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​c. The News Profile: centers on the subject&amp;#8217;s connection to a news&lt;br /&gt;
event. Also could be called, as the Times does (or used to): Man in
the&lt;br /&gt;
News. Person in the&amp;nbsp;News?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan Maslow&lt;/em&gt;, June&amp;nbsp;2004&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-enterprise-project"&gt;The Enterprise&amp;nbsp;project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our conference call with Cleveland Plain Dealer writer Connie
Schultz, she mentioned several methods that helped her narrative series
&amp;#8220;The Burden of Innocence,&amp;#8221; which was the subject of our brown bag
writers group. They are excellent practices, not only for narrative
journalism, but for any enterprise&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1) &lt;strong&gt;Write as you go&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schultz said she always transcribed her notes as soon as possible and
kept them in files organized by month as she worked on the series over
the course of one year. Any project that involves reporting over time
benefits from having well-organized notes from interviews and reporting.
It puts the writer ahead of the curve when you get down to the business
of writing. This practice can be easily extended to the practice of
writing&lt;br /&gt;
themes, sections, scenes, dialogue, good quotes, etc. as you go. Don&amp;#8217;t
imagine you can wait until you&amp;#8217;re reporting is done, then look back at
your notebooks or journal and suddenly pull the white rabbit out of the
hat. Doesn&amp;#8217;t work like&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2) &lt;strong&gt;Writing a Map/ outline&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schultz said that before she started to write, her editor asked for a
written map, a term she described as having less onerous associations
than outline. The map or outline provides writer and editor with a guide
to the story, where it starts, where it goes, what it&amp;#8217;s about, where it
ends. It makes the writer think. It need not be followed like a
contract. Whatever it&amp;#8217;s called, this best practice is one of the
quintessential building blocks of longer-length writing. Without it, you
are, effectively, roaming around blindfolded, hoping to pin the tail on
the donkey. With a roadmap or outline, even if rudimentary (many are the
outlines noted on the back of a cocktail napkin; Tolstoy outlined Anna
Karenina on a railroad train dining car menu (which, however, later fell
behind the sofa at his estate Yasnaya Polyana, forcing him to write War
&lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Peace first instead, but that is another story)).you can focus on the
material and how to express it accurately, faily and gracefully, not on
what to write&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3) &lt;strong&gt;Rewriting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schultz said rewriting was the most painful part&amp;#8212; she went through a
dozen major drafts. But rewriting is an absolutely necessary practice to
achieve successful narratives/enterprise stories. If you are to become a
skilled pro writer, you must get past the idea that rewriting means you
are doing something wrong. Rewriting is, in fact, doing something right:
Improving the story, draft by draft. No story has ever suffered from
rewriting. Many suffered from too little rewriting. Just as the
map/outline helps the writer through the first draft, the editor&amp;#8217;s read
and conferencing helps the writer through rewrite. Talk out what needs
to be done. Partner. Writers don&amp;#8217;t need to accept everything an editor
says, like medicine or punishment. Writers do need to defend and
articulate something they want to keep. Develop a collaborative rewrite
strategy and get to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4) &lt;strong&gt;Writing buddies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scultz said she chooses another writer in the newsroom she respects to
critique her pieces, so that she has an additional sounding board
outside the editors-reporter loop. Practically every mature writer does
this, asking colleagues or friends to read the work and tell the brutal
truth. However, this practice really depends on choosing someone with
good judgment, analytical skill and the ability to articulate and
criticize&gt; constructively. Anything less is less than&amp;nbsp;helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan Maslow&lt;/em&gt;, April&amp;nbsp;2003&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="edit-proof-copy"&gt;&lt;a href="/files/tips/editproofmanual.pdf"&gt;Edit Proof&amp;nbsp;copy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. The reporter&amp;#8217;s constant focus should be on the question: &lt;strong&gt;what is
this story about?&lt;/strong&gt; That helps shape the lede, the angle, the structure,
everything. Also, editors should keep reporters focused on this question
throughout the day so that the reporter refines and hones the story to
present the reader with a tight, concise, well-organized story without
holes, digressions or&amp;nbsp;frills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. There&amp;#8217;s a natural contradiction between the creative process and&lt;br /&gt;
critical thinking, between writer or storyteller inside us and the
editor or&lt;br /&gt;
critic inside. The critic suppresses the storyteller and makes it
harder for&lt;br /&gt;
the storyteller to tell the story. That&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s so hard to write a
solid&lt;br /&gt;
lede: every time the storyteller wants to put a thought down, the
critic&lt;br /&gt;
says ,&amp;#8221;that stinks,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;that&amp;#8217;s not good enough.&amp;#8221; So Chip Scanlon talked
about &amp;#8220;lowering your standards&amp;#8221; when you draft your story. I think a
better way to say this is to suspend your critical faculties while you
are writing your first draft and just get it down using your creative
juices. Then switch over to your critical faculties to rewrite, sharpen,
trim,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. &lt;strong&gt;A topic is not a story&lt;/strong&gt;. You can&amp;#8217;t write about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;, or mass
transit, or affordable housing. Those are topics. A story has to have a
beginning, middle and end. It has to have characters. It has to have a
plot.&lt;br /&gt;
It has to have a setting. This is a cogent point. How many times do
editors hear from reporters, &amp;#8220;I want to write about poverty in
Paterson.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I want to write about the Passaic River.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I want to write
about race relations between latinos and blacks.&amp;#8221; How many times do
reporters hear from editors: &amp;#8220;We should do a story about high property
taxes.&amp;#8221; Well what about it? Themes are not stories. Think about telling
stories. It&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;elemental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Words of wisdom from Don Murray, a legendary writing coach, on&lt;br /&gt;
organizing and &amp;#8220;mapping&amp;#8221; the reporting and writing of a story:
&lt;strong&gt;explore, focus, rehearse, draft, clarify&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Experienced reporters know what is the least amount of reporting&lt;br /&gt;
they need to do for any given story. Great reporters know there is no
limit&lt;br /&gt;
except deadline for reporting, and that the quality of a story really,
truly&lt;br /&gt;
depends on the reporting, not the writing. If you don&amp;#8217;t know as many
facts&lt;br /&gt;
and factoids as you possibly can, the story is going to be thin and
pale.&lt;br /&gt;
Somebody said, &amp;#8220;Reporting is taking a beer keg information and
squeezing it into a perfume&amp;nbsp;bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​6. A good way to start the process: reporter and editor brainstorm&lt;br /&gt;
on reader&amp;#8217;s questions. What does the reader need to and want to know
about the story. That helps the reporter focuse on question above: What
is this story&amp;nbsp;about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​7. Rick Bragg&amp;#8217;s five boxes. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Times reporter Rick Bragg learned&lt;br /&gt;
from a mentor that he should organize and write his stories as if he
had&lt;br /&gt;
five empty boxes floating in the air above him: In the first box, he
put the&lt;br /&gt;
lede or grabber. In the second, the nut graf: what&amp;#8217;s this story about.
In&lt;br /&gt;
the third box, tell the story. In the fourth, info, context, back
story,&lt;br /&gt;
etc. And in the fifth, the kicker, the ending, something that leaves
the&lt;br /&gt;
reader with emotional&amp;nbsp;meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​8. Jack Hart, enterprise editor at The Oregonian: Don&amp;#8217;t confuse&lt;br /&gt;
anecdotes in anecdotal ledes with scenesetters. &lt;strong&gt;Anecdotes are little
stories, with their own beginning and end. Scenesetters just get the
reader to the right&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;place.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​9. Get rid of dependent clauses in your&amp;nbsp;sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​10. &lt;strong&gt;To revise, you need to achieve distance&lt;/strong&gt;. You can&amp;#8217;t plunge right
into a revision. You have to take a break, do something else for a
while, eat something or drink something, divert your attention, go for a
walk, something. Everyone finds their own way to get a distance on
his/her own work. Whatever cools the engine down then revs it up&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan Maslow&lt;/em&gt;, May&amp;nbsp;2005&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="story-conception-and-execution"&gt;Story conception and&amp;nbsp;execution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From notes taken during &lt;a href="http://www.journalism.missouri.edu/faculty/jacqui-banaszynski.html"&gt;Jacqui Banaszynski&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; visit to the Herald
News on Aug. 14,&amp;nbsp;2004.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to tell people what the news means and what&amp;#8217;s its&amp;nbsp;significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get a story assignment, immediately sit down and brainstorm for
five&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brainstorm questions, not even to necessarily use in an&amp;nbsp;interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything you think you know, turn it into a&amp;nbsp;question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask&amp;nbsp;yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you want to&amp;nbsp;know?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you curious&amp;nbsp;about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the stakeholders in the&amp;nbsp;story?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, do this again so you have ideas for second day&amp;nbsp;stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most stories, you write the first-day story. On the second day, you
do a story that&amp;#8217;s very wide, takes in all the questions but is not very&amp;nbsp;deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, do six or seven deep stories of varying&amp;nbsp;types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profiles -&amp;nbsp;character-based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues/trends - ideas,&amp;nbsp;fashion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigative -&amp;nbsp;records-based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanatory - a teachable&amp;nbsp;moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descriptive/voices - use telling&amp;nbsp;details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narratives - scenes &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;dialogue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visuals - using graphics and boxes to tell the&amp;nbsp;story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editors want a working &lt;a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&amp;amp;aid=34457"&gt;nut graf&lt;/a&gt; when you pitch a story. Do some
preliminary&amp;nbsp;reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each editor is looking for something different, get to know each of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a budget line helps you establish goals. Write your working
budget line as&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a colleague who will read your ledes in progress and to discuss
story craft&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ledes engage the reader. Don&amp;#8217;t misdirect the reader. Lede them with
foreshadowing and&amp;nbsp;summarize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;, don&amp;#8217;t frontload a lot of&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lede should signal the tone and voice of the&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vary the pacing and rhythm and length of your sentences. Long sentences
read fast. Then a short sentance halts the&amp;nbsp;reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;[20 more tips from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;][]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These notes were compiled from discussions with The Record&amp;#8217;s Passaic
County bureau editor Claude Deltieure. He is incredibly knowledgeable
about local and school budgets in New Jersey and has been very generous
with his&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budgets are made up of two main sections, revenues (income) and
appropriations (spending). In an ideal world, these two would match&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenues&lt;/strong&gt;\                                            &lt;strong&gt;Appropriations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Property taxes\                                          Current expenses (salaries and other expenses)&lt;br /&gt;
  State &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Federal aid (fluctuates and may not come)\       Capital outlay (big ticket repairs)&lt;br /&gt;
  Miscellaneous revenues (fees, licenses, court costs)\    Debt service (payment on municipal loans)
   Surplus (carried over from last&amp;nbsp;year)                   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Claude is fond of saying, municipal financing New Jersey is &amp;#8220;built
for idiots.&amp;#8221; You have to &amp;#8220;appropriate&amp;#8221; the public dollar to use it for a
specific purpose. The governing body must vote to do this to pay any and
all bills. Capital outlay is defined as durable goods that last more
than three&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your job, as a reporter, is to give readers an idea of how their taxes
are going to go up and explain&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total property tax bill is made up of several components:&lt;br /&gt;
municipal services&lt;br /&gt;
schools&lt;br /&gt;
county&lt;br /&gt;
open space tax&lt;br /&gt;
regional district tax&lt;br /&gt;
fire&lt;br /&gt;
garbage&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/losap/losap.shtml"&gt;Length of service annuity&amp;nbsp;program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Length of Service annuity is meant to help support volunteer
firefighters and ambulance corps. Each town will pay for a volunteer&amp;#8217;s
equipment, and this money must cover that. One-penny on the tax rate
goes to the annuities to be paid to a volunteer upon&amp;nbsp;retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey also ran out of landfill space 20 years ago, so it must pay
astronomical amounts to handle its&amp;nbsp;garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional districts are shared and provide rural schools that cover
several towns. The towns that &amp;#8220;send&amp;#8221; their students to school in another
town must pay for those&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to tell your readers that the municipal services tax is going
up, not just that taxes as a whole are&amp;nbsp;rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state overseer of all issues regarding local finance is the
&lt;a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/"&gt;Division of Local Government Services&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/"&gt;Department of
Community Affairs&lt;/a&gt;. In many ways, it functions like a state version of
the &lt;a href="http://www.gao.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGS&lt;/span&gt; reviews every municipal budget and must approve&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council does not &amp;#8220;pass&amp;#8221; a budget. It first &amp;#8220;introduces&amp;#8221; it to the
town&amp;#8217;s residents. Once the council introduces a budget, you as a
reporter must be allowed to get a copy. They cannot give you a summary
version. The council will then go on to &amp;#8220;adopt&amp;#8221; the budget. A governing
body in New Jersey must have a two-thirds majority to pass a spending&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact in dollars and&amp;nbsp;sense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of your property taxes is based on the value of one-penny per
\$100 of the taxable value of your property. Each town hires an
independent assessment firm every few years to perform a &amp;#8220;revaluation&amp;#8221;
of its properties. On that, it bases its property tax&amp;nbsp;assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax rate is based on how much money your town collected last year.
If you only collected 95 percent of the taxes last year, you can collect
105 percent this&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That extra 5 percent, if you can collect it, is set aside as a &amp;#8220;reserve
for uncollected taxes&amp;#8221;. If this year you collect 98 percent of your
taxes, that extra 2 percent goes into your surplus and reserve. The
reserve is anything you didn&amp;#8217;t spend last&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surplus in the current budget comes out of last year&amp;#8217;s reserve.
Towns will often underestimate their expected tax collection rate, or
overestimate their appropriations so that at the end of the fiscal year,
they will have money left over to build their surplus. A surplus should
be between 3 and 5 percent of the total budget. You need to be able to
communicate to your readers this pull-and-tug of making the revenues and
appropriations match&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to know how many tax dollars come into your town if you collect
one penny per \$100 of assessed&amp;nbsp;valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, call your town&amp;#8217;s tax assessor and ask for the total valuation of
your town. You can also find it on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; Web site &lt;a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/taxes/taxmenu.shtml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If the
total value of your town is \$3 billion, one tax point will raise
\$300,000. So for every \$300,000 in spending the city plans, it will
levy one point in&amp;nbsp;taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply that to the average reader, multiply the tax-point times the
average assessed value of a property in your town. Again, you can find
this out from your tax assessor (who really should become your best
friend), or from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the average property in your town is worth \$100,000, and your
council wants to buy a \$1.2 million jet for the mayor, how much will
that cost your average&amp;nbsp;taxpayer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the average tax rate for each person: Divide \$100,000 by \$100
and then by 100 pennies. That gives you \$10. So for each tax point that
the town raises its taxes, the average homeowner will pay \$10 more. If
the municipality pays for the entire \$1.2 million jet, that will cost 4
tax points (\$1.2 million divided by \$300,000 per tax point). That will
cost your average taxpayer \$40 more each year (4 tax points times \$10
per point for the average&amp;nbsp;home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring this out can help you paint spending decisions in a way readers
can grasp. You should have these base figures&amp;#8212;the total valuation, the
tax point and the average value of a home&amp;#8212;handy for each of your&amp;nbsp;towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School districts also receive state aid based on a formula. The state
expects each district to pay \$10,000 each year to educate each student.
The state looks at the average income and property values of each town
to see how much it can afford of that \$10,000 per student. If it
doesn&amp;#8217;t have the money, the state will pay for the essentials. But arts
and other programs, such as music, can not receive this &amp;#8220;state
equalization aid&amp;#8221; from&amp;nbsp;Trenton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These budgets can be very confusing, but as a reporter, you need to
learn as much as you can about how they work. You must be able to talk
shop with elected officials about the budgets to be able to detect
attempts at slipping items through without the public&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Tom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When we&amp;#8217;re writing budget stories, local officials often omit key
numbers that every reader wants to know. To help ensure that you don&amp;#8217;t
forget to press them to fill in the blanks, here&amp;#8217;s a handy checklist of
the key figures you need to ask for. Every budget story must include
this&amp;nbsp;graf:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the adopted (proposed) 2010 budget, the owner of a home
assessed at the borough average of \$65,000 will pay \$2,395 in
municipal (school/county) taxes, a rise of \$99.70 from last year or
4.4&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember:&lt;br /&gt;
1. The fiscal year&lt;br /&gt;
2. The average home assessment&lt;br /&gt;
3. The total amount of that average municipal/school/county tax bill&lt;br /&gt;
4. The total dollar increase in the average tax bill&lt;br /&gt;
5. The percent increase in the average tax&amp;nbsp;bill&lt;/p&gt;

aren&amp;#8217;t there already people doing&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t intend to denigrate the years of service by so many passionate
and intelligent fans. I wish they could have been compensated even a
fraction for the sweat they&amp;#8217;ve poured into writing about the&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with varying degrees of success, some organizations are attempting
what I propose, to support legions of writers with the values and
resources of their ancestors in newsprint. There&amp;#8217;s a battalion, at
least, of &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/RichardFarley"&gt;podcasters&lt;/a&gt;. There are networks of soccer scribes
like &lt;a href="http://american-soccer-news.com/"&gt;American-Soccer-News.com&lt;/a&gt;. And then there&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/"&gt;MLSsoccer.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a little debate about whether fans should consider
MLSsoccer.com to be a legitimate and credible news outlet. Forget for a
moment that no other major organizations provide comprehensive reporting
on the domestic leagues (even though one would expect that &lt;a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team/_/team/660/united-states?cc=5901&amp;amp;ver=us"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESPN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/usa"&gt;Fox Soccer&lt;/a&gt; would want to mount such an effort) and that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MLS&lt;/span&gt; is
simply stepping into the breach to give fans what they want.  With the
sweeping inhouse relaunch of the site this season, the league and its
employees clearly plan to &amp;#8220;cover&amp;#8221; the sport, both here and abroad. But
should they, and if not, what role should the league&amp;#8217;s official website&amp;nbsp;play?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/tom.ginger.meagher/VFire?authkey=Gv1sRgCLHv_tuQ1JzmnwE&amp;amp;feat=embedwebsite" /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to remind ourselves that MLSsoccer.com is the public relations
arm of a major corporation. Many fans would agree that we really can&amp;#8217;t
trust the site to give us honest, straightforward reportage on issues
that are less than flattering to the league as a whole. As other writers
(including [one at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Mens National Team Players Association&amp;#8217;s
official website][]) have observed, it&amp;#8217;s like watching a snake eat its
own tail when you try to get information from an official mouthpiece
that also attempts to cover the news. You don&amp;#8217;t rely on the Federal
Reserve for unbiased, critical and important writing about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; monetary
policy. You don&amp;#8217;t need to do it with your favorite sport&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLSsoccer.com ought to be a repository of fast, easy-to-find video and
(I credit this concept entirely to &lt;a href="http://soccer.fakesigi.com/2010/04/mls-website-panic-switch.html"&gt;FakeSigi&lt;/a&gt;) openly accessible
statistical data. The site should create a public &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to allow fans to
use the league&amp;#8217;s entire database of historical game and player
statistics. One can imagine how a blog like &lt;a href="http://usasoccer.blogspot.com/"&gt;Climbing the Ladder&lt;/a&gt;,
which I believe does its analysis with its own cobbled-together data,
could be even cooler if it had the actual league stats to tinker&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although MLSsoccer.com is keeping more than a few people gainfully
employed, I want to see more organizations spring up so that so many
writers aren&amp;#8217;t directly dependent on the league to make a living. We
need to find ways to support good, young soccer writers so they can
work, report and get better at their craft without having to shill for&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MLS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="unravel-the-conflicting-interests"&gt;Unravel the conflicting&amp;nbsp;interests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside MLSsoccer.com, much of the writing on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; game resembles
the pamphleteering of the early Republic. Lots of Whigs and Federalists
write blogs for like-minded folks, but their own biases can make them
hard to take&amp;nbsp;seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some good coverage of the sport comes from partisans, I don&amp;#8217;t
want the writer on whom I rely to be staked in the camp of any one team.
There shouldn&amp;#8217;t be any fans in the press box. Stories and podcasts about
games shouldn&amp;#8217;t include the word &amp;#8220;we.&amp;#8221; Soccer fans are incredibly
passionate, and they go to great lengths to identify with their teams.
But I want knowledgeable, independent writers, free of the auspices of
the league and its card-carrying supporters&amp;nbsp;clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, I&amp;#8217;d like to see American soccer writers, professional and
amateur, adopt the ethical guidelines of the &lt;a href="http://apsportseditors.org/"&gt;Associated Press Sports
Editors&lt;/a&gt;. As an organization, the &lt;a href="http://www.soccerreporters.com/"&gt;North American Soccer Reporters&lt;/a&gt;
should publicly lean on its members, particularly those not affiliated
with news agencies with their own ethics policies, to subscribe &lt;a href="http://apsportseditors.org/apse-ethics-guidelines/"&gt;to this
code&lt;/a&gt;. It reads, in&amp;nbsp;part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editors and reporters should avoid taking part in outside activities
or employment that might create conflict of interest or even
appearance of a&amp;nbsp;conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They should not serve as an official scorer at baseball&amp;nbsp;games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They should not write for team or league media guides or other
    team or league publications. This has the potential of
    compromising a reporter’s disinterested&amp;nbsp;observations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As fans, we pay to support soccer in this country, whether in satellite
packages or scarves. If for no other reason than we want to make sure
that our money is well spent, we should expect the people who deliver
the news to be minding the bank rather than boosting their club. The
only hitch: we may have to pay more to get what we&amp;nbsp;deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="no-more-free-transfers"&gt;No more free&amp;nbsp;transfers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, we need more neutral, unaffiliated writers who embody
the traditional values of newspaper journalism. In an ideal world, that
would come with a major investment to create a news organization that
could do justice to soccer&amp;#8217;s huge potential in this&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there have been a handful of single proprietors who have been
successful at making a living on the internet as soccer hacks, most
notably my former &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/"&gt;Herald News&lt;/a&gt; colleague &lt;a href="http://www.soccerbyives.typepad.com/"&gt;Ives Galarcep&lt;/a&gt;. But I&amp;#8217;m
proposing an online publication that would require the footprint and
resources of a larger organization to make it&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/daed.2010.139.2.26"&gt;several&amp;#8212;largely untested&amp;#8212;business models&lt;/a&gt; that, with the
right editorial direction and an angel investor or two, could produce
soccer news worth paying for. Not everything needs to be locked behind a
pay wall. Until relatively recently, &lt;a href="http://www.socceramerica.com/"&gt;Soccer America&lt;/a&gt; did just that, a
print-focused decision that could be argued largely blunted its
influence as the demand for soccer news on the web exploded. I&amp;#8217;m not
advocating for any particular model, whether its based on subscriptions,
syndication, micropayments or the like. But readers need to understand
that you can really only get the stories you want when a publication can
pay for the work it takes to dig them&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in my career, I wrote about the Kansas City Wizards for Cyber
Soccer Associates, a group that still exists and now maintains the
&lt;a href="http://american-soccer-news.com/"&gt;American Soccer News&lt;/a&gt; site. For two seasons,
I followed the team, writing game previews and match reports. I hesitate
to say I &amp;#8220;covered&amp;#8221; the Wizards. As a part-time writer, I didn&amp;#8217;t have the
time to attend training sessions, and I really had no idea what I was
doing. I didn&amp;#8217;t develop stories or break news. I mostly reacted and
transcribed game events. It was a great gig, but in retrospect I see the
missed opportunities to go deeper. The model of American Soccer News,
and I believe &lt;a href="http://www.theoffside.com/"&gt;The Offside&lt;/a&gt; as well, is to create a network of
volunteer writers dedicated to individual teams and link them all under
one banner. It&amp;#8217;s a great idea, but it falls short in a couple of key
aspects: it&amp;#8217;s a part-time gig at best, and there&amp;#8217;s a tendency for the
writers to be advocates for the teams rather than probing&amp;nbsp;journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all leads me once more to a key question, as &lt;a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/2009/11/long-winded-post-on-future-of-soccer.html"&gt;Richard Whittall&lt;/a&gt;
has asked time and&amp;nbsp;again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t most soccer bloggers secretly consider a career writing for a
major news organization with all its resources, access, accreditation
and living-ish wages, the ultimate endgame for their online&amp;nbsp;endeavours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;Is this after all just a fun little hobby? And if not, what are we
all going to do about it? Are traditional pay-for-content models
really and truly&amp;nbsp;dead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper industry has largely ignored soccer, but the values of the
daily print journalist are hard to beat. And the truly good newspaper
reporter is impossible to replace for free. With all the writers
slogging away at this subject, we have the raw talent. We have the
knowledge. We have a market for the news. The soccer fan should be an
advertiser&amp;#8217;s dream demographic. We need the business acumen that can
monetize the news so that writers can make the jump from dedicated and
sometimes gifted amateurs to professional reporters, with all the
accountability and responsibility that&amp;nbsp;entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things on which American soccer fans can generally agree.
We want thriving, world-class domestic leagues, for both men and women,
and we want the men&amp;#8217;s national team to win the World Cup. At this point,
we&amp;#8217;re decades, if not generations away from realizing those dreams. But
we can get there by taking one step at a time, and the most important
step is to keep the sport alive here long enough for it to&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vigorous press, despite its shortcomings, has always been vital for a
strong democracy. For soccer to continue to grow in America, we need a
stronger, independent press. To do it right, to have professional
reporters competing to break stories in every city with a team, it will
cost money. For soccer fans and other interested readers, it may be end
up being cheap, but it won&amp;#8217;t be free. At the end of the day, for the
sport we all love, it will be a small price to&amp;nbsp;pay.&lt;/p&gt;

soccer fan whose zeal for the sport approaches fanaticism. But over the
last 15 years, I&amp;#8217;ve driven myself crazy trying to find news about the
professional game in all its domestic incarnations, whether it be &lt;a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com"&gt;Major
League Soccer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.womensprosoccer.com/"&gt;Women&amp;#8217;s Professional Soccer&lt;/a&gt; or one of the &lt;a href="http://www.ussoccer.com/USSF-D2-Pro-League/USSF-D2-Pro-League.aspx"&gt;lower
divisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make my living editing local news&amp;#8212;town councils, zoning boards,
school boards&amp;#8212;for a daily newspaper. It&amp;#8217;s been doubly frustrating for
me then that a large majority of my colleagues in the media consider
soccer to be a third-class&amp;nbsp;sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By and large, soccer is ignored or, at best, squirreled away among the
agate results, somewhere behind junior high water polo. Much has been
written in the blogosphere about how soccer is a sport &lt;a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/2010/03/some-thoughts-on-internet-and-football.html"&gt;tailor-made for
the internet&lt;/a&gt;. With the advent over the past couple of years of
prevalent, cheap and quick streaming video, anyone can now watch live
games from around the world. You don&amp;#8217;t need broadcasters to watch the
game. And you don&amp;#8217;t need your major metropolitan daily newspaper to read
about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the willful ignorance of newspapers and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;, soccer fans
like me have created their own media. Blogs, webzines, podcasts and
other online publications have proliferated, sustained by fans who
weren&amp;#8217;t getting the news and analysis they wanted. In many ways,
American fans have provided a perfect example of the &amp;#8220;citizen
journalism&amp;#8221; movement that &lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/"&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; has been preaching about all
these&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been great to see the level of engagement by so many regular fans,
but I still find myself yearning for more. I want deeper reporting,
better writing and smarter analysis. I want it all packaged in an
attractive design, and I want more of it every day. I daydream about a
soccer publication that embodies some of the best values of newspaper
journalism infused with all the potential of the digital&amp;nbsp;realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-familiar-refrain"&gt;A familiar&amp;nbsp;refrain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the better critics and writers in the soccer blogosphere have
tackled this subject before. I&amp;#8217;m certainly not alone. &lt;a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/"&gt;A More Splendid
Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchinvasion.net/"&gt;Pitch Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.thisisamericansoccer.com/"&gt;This is American Soccer&lt;/a&gt; and others far
more clever and thoughtful than me have bemoaned the same problem. A lot
of readers want better coverage of the sport, on both the professional
and amateur levels. But there are so few opportunities to make &lt;a href="http://pitchinvasion.net/blog/2009/11/18/the-sweeper-the-future-of-soccer-journalism-debate/"&gt;a living
at soccer writing&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s difficult to expect anyone to answer the
Siren call as anything more than a&amp;nbsp;hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem begins with the big mainstream purveyors of sports
journalism, the newspapers and magazines that have traditionally funded
serious and ongoing reporting. They won&amp;#8217;t, for the most part, touch
soccer. Sure, we&amp;#8217;ll see a few features between now and &lt;a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/"&gt;July 11&lt;/a&gt;, but
that&amp;#8217;s about it. At many publications, if they even have a soccer
writer, he or she is pretty far down in the newsroom pecking order.
They&amp;#8217;re lucky if their stories get any kind of play on the cover of the
sports section at&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine. We&amp;#8217;ve spent the better part of two decades whining about this.
Soccer speaks for itself. The market for the game is growing and will
continue to expand for some time to come. As &lt;a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/2010/03/some-thoughts-on-internet-and-football.html%20%20"&gt;Richard Whittall&lt;/a&gt;
correctly&amp;nbsp;observes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as large, ungainly media outlets are forced to cut costs and
broaden content, in-depth sports journalism will be left to a sea of
independent, often fan-biased bloggers working with their own
resources. Many club supporters will be smarter, more connected, and
more knowledgeable as information about club and league power
structures are exposed to an increasingly-global fan&amp;nbsp;base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vibrant and growing community of writers that has evolved online has
been a great (if only partial) antidote. In some ways, this grassroots
journalism resembles the punk rock and Jamaican music scenes of the &amp;#8216;60s
and &amp;#8216;70s. If you don&amp;#8217;t find what you want, do it yourself. This attitude
has served soccer well at a time when the internet enables anyone with
the chutzpah to pretend to be an expert and the free time to devote to
it to become a soccer pundit with hundreds, if not thousands of
followers. The laptop and Wordpress are the three chords of the internet
revolution. Anyone can do it, and when the &amp;#8220;professionals&amp;#8221; won&amp;#8217;t, anyone&amp;nbsp;will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-super-subs"&gt;The super&amp;nbsp;subs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I researched this piece, I kept finding (or being reminded of) more
and more examples of very nice work being done by amateurs, bloggers and
professionals&amp;nbsp;alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s The Run of Play, whose &lt;a href="http://www.runofplay.com/2010/04/22/mourinho-guardiola/"&gt;ether binge cultural criticism&lt;/a&gt; is
nothing if not fascinating (not to mention its design, which is truly
unique in this genre). There&amp;#8217;s the pseudonymous Fake Sigi (a Fake Steve
Jobs aimed at those who follow one of Major League Soccer&amp;#8217;s most
successful and rotund coaches, Sigi Schmid), whose &lt;a href="http://www.fakesigi.com/2010/04/mls-web-site-disaster.html"&gt;scathing dissection
and analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the league-run mouthpiece, MLSsoccer.com, has been a
real revelation in recent&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#8217;s the fan-oriented networks of bloggers and podcasters who
spend countless hours watching, breaking down and reviewing matches.
Many of them conduct interviews with players, coaches and officials as
well as journalists and fellow fans. &lt;a href="http://www.seeingredny.com/"&gt;Seeing Red&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively new
podcast covering the New York Red Bulls, has been a valuable addition
this season to the coverage of the team from the fan&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(In the spirit of full disclosure, over the past six years, I have
edited a pair of soccer blogs, on my own and for my former newspaper.
Those experiences, and their unceremonious ends, give me even more
respect for those who continue to slog away at the daily grind of&amp;nbsp;blogging.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to these the traditional newspaper and magazine journalists who have
taken to the web and social networks to hone their brand and solidify
their command of the beat: &lt;a href="http://www.soccerbyives.net/"&gt;Ives Galarcep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/"&gt;Steve Goff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/grantwahl"&gt;Grant
Wahl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/"&gt;Jack Bell&lt;/a&gt; and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a lot to like. Still, we can and should all expect a lot&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably, some bloggers and amateur reporters can adopt a
defensive posture on the subject of professionalism. It&amp;#8217;s not unique to
soccer writing, and it&amp;#8217;s certainly not unique to America. Although the
issues are somewhat different in England, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lukeymoore"&gt;Lukey Moore&lt;/a&gt;, one of the
fanatics behind the hilarious, exceptional and smart &lt;a href="http://www.thefootballramble.com/"&gt;Football Ramble&lt;/a&gt;
podcast, elucidated this view &lt;a href="http://www.toepoke.net/post/2010/04/30/The-Football-Ramble.aspx"&gt;in a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a backlash in the media these days against things
like amateur blogs and podcasts, a lot of journalists think that the
general public&amp;#8217;s opinions are not as valid because they are not
&amp;#8216;proper journalists&amp;#8217;. Doesn&amp;#8217;t really bother me though, I can count on
one hand the number of football journalists I actually&amp;nbsp;respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no argument that professional caliber journalists don&amp;#8217;t hold a
monopoly on opinions or incisive commentary. But in one important
regard, they can&amp;#8217;t be beat. Few others have the time, patience or
ability to build relationships with sources in the game that can unlock
difficult stories. That kind of deep reporting can grant them the
authority to ask the unpopular questions that the powers-that-be would
rather&amp;nbsp;ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-need-for-game-changers"&gt;The need for&amp;nbsp;game-changers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my little free time, I want to read something about soccer in North
America that: a) I didn&amp;#8217;t know already, b) casts a critical eye on the
sport, and c) comes from someone who is a skeptical spectator,
disinterested in the outcome of any particular&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few dozen solid reporters on the beat in this country, as
the roster of the &lt;a href="http://www.soccerreporters.com/"&gt;North American Soccer Reporters&lt;/a&gt; will attest. But
there aren&amp;#8217;t nearly&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Times executive editor Bill Keller&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/books/review/Keller-t.html%20%20"&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt;of a
biography of Henry Luce captured a bit of my&amp;nbsp;quandary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;a significant population of serious people feel the need for
someone with training, experience and standards — reporters and
editors — to help them dig up and sort through the news, identify
what’s important and make sense of it. That in no way precludes
enlisting the audience as commentators, as contributors and as
collaborators. (Witness the splendid hybrid of professional and
amateur journalism that has kept alive the stream of news from&amp;nbsp;Iran.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days, it seems that 99 percent of soccer &amp;#8220;news&amp;#8221; could be classified
as either game transcripts or outright &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/GrantWahl/status/13805381375"&gt;boosterism&lt;/a&gt;. I read quite a
bit of it, but I also want the news that you can really only get by
chasing it full time, building relationships with players, front office
staff, owners, league employees, coaches and referees over the&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the jargon of my industry, I want more of the old media&amp;#8217;s values in
this new media sport: Accountability, speed, skepticism, fearless
questioning of authority. Get it fast and get it right, and when you
don&amp;#8217;t get it right, own up to your mistake and correct it. Without these
kind of mores suffused into our writers, I worry that far too many
important stories are crying out for more reporting. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/CdnSoccerBlog/status/13805459081"&gt;What happened to
Charlie Davies&lt;/a&gt; on the night of his accident? What is going on with
&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/soccer/articles/2010/04/28/revolutions_joseph_in_substance_abuse_program/"&gt;Shalrie Joseph&amp;#8217;s life&lt;/a&gt; and career? What kind of negotiations went
into crafting Major League Soccer&amp;#8217;s latest labor&amp;nbsp;agreement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems there&amp;#8217;s a disconnect between soccer writing and news
journalism. I go to work every day and ask questions of people in power
because I act as a proxy for the regular, taxpaying resident. There is a
presumption that government should be open and accountable. Regardless
of how much we couch it in terms of passion, culture and tradition,
soccer is a business. It&amp;#8217;s becoming a very lucrative business, and it&amp;#8217;s
very closely held. It&amp;#8217;s a private enterprise, and thus there isn&amp;#8217;t that
same moral authority to ask questions and demand answers. But still,
reporters should be using their access, knowledge and insight on behalf
of the average&amp;nbsp;fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone needs to ask probing questions. We need reporters to help hold
managers and clubs responsible for their mistakes, whether they be poor
tactical decisions at a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Open Cup match or the financial mismanagement
of an entire club (See: Portsmouth, Leeds, Crystal Palace, Chester City,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; Sol, Miami Fusion, etc). We&amp;#8217;re being sold a product, whether it&amp;#8217;s
season tickets or jerseys or television advertising. If we&amp;#8217;re going to
invest our money (not to mention time and energy), it should be worth
our&amp;nbsp;investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
[Marie Hardin][], a professor at Penn State&amp;#8217;s [John Curley Center for
Sports Journalism][], [wrote a piece][] in 2007 arguing for a stronger
ethical grounding for sports reporters:

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One has to wonder what other stories in the public interest (about
systematic problems and corruption in sports, including those at the
prep level) may have also gone unwritten. Although perceived as fun
and games, sports at almost every level in the United States have
become big business with consequences beyond the playing fields.
Sports journalists have an ethical obligation to provide citizens and
consumers with fair and balanced reporting on issues that affect their
communities, their pocketbooks and the health and educations of their&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in America, we need more reporters walking the soccer beat day in
and day out, particularly in towns that aren&amp;#8217;t so sexy. We need more
people in Kansas City, St. Louis, Salt Lake City and Dallas, for
example. We need more people asking tough questions and competing with
the writers already out there. A competitor breathing down your neck
really helps you kick it into gear and get a better&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get more writers (which I&amp;#8217;ll discuss in a second part
tomorrow), we need to add the values of professional journalism to the
healthy and established internet community of writers. I&amp;#8217;m not
advocating for a new alliance of bloggers, each sitting in his own
apartment and riffing, linking back and forth. I&amp;#8217;m talking about a
serious, concerted effort to groom, deploy and support soccer&amp;nbsp;writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomorrow, I&amp;#8217;ll discuss how the writers we have can get better and what
we&amp;#8217;ll need to do to get more of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

surgery. I spent most of the time lounging on the sofa and watching
European soccer games on &lt;a href="http://www.espn3.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESPN3&lt;/span&gt;.com&lt;/a&gt;. But I also stumbled upon a great
series of podcasts that walked me through how and why journalists
should bushwhack into the social media&amp;nbsp;frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programs, essentially a series of lo-fi internet radio call-in
shows, were hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.sree.net/"&gt;Sree Sreenivasan&lt;/a&gt;, dean of student affairs at
Columbia University&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1165270051346/page/1175295297393/JRNHomePage.htm"&gt;Graduate School of Journalism&lt;/a&gt;. Like everyone
else on the planet, I had been &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2008/11/getting-social-networked/"&gt;dabbling in Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and I had heard
a lot about Twitter but didn&amp;#8217;t understand how to use either very well,
particularly as a&amp;nbsp;journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I charged through &lt;a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/profile.aspx?userurl=columbiajournalism%20%20"&gt;Sree&amp;#8217;s programs&lt;/a&gt; (mostly using Google&amp;#8217;s
excellent &lt;a href="http://listen.googlelabs.com/"&gt;Listen app&lt;/a&gt; on my Android phone). The most helpful were the
episodes on &lt;a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2010/02/05/basic-twitter-for-journalists"&gt;Basic Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2009/09/18/facebook-for-journos"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for journalists. They
gave some practical, but simple background on each service and shared
advice from other working professionals. It was enough to make me feel
comfortable&amp;nbsp;experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went to pick up more of the episodes, which covered topics
like &lt;a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2009/02/06/launching-your-own-media-business"&gt;launching your own media company&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2009/10/15/google-docs-for-journalists"&gt;using Google Docs in
reporting&lt;/a&gt; and what exactly &lt;a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2009/01/23/linkedin-for-journalists"&gt;are we supposed to do with LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio quality wasn&amp;#8217;t crystal clear, but the medium was simple and
straightforward. Before finding these, I was addicted to my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds,
checking each one religiously throughout the work day. I now can go
three or four days without even remembering to open Google&amp;nbsp;Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, with Twitter I have this incredible, if sometimes overwhelming,
stream of information coming at me in (often) clever, funny snippets.
And with its open, collaborative nature, it&amp;#8217;s far more likely that I&amp;#8217;ll
be turned on to new, engaging news sources and writers than I ever would
find by reading hundreds of individual blogs. I&amp;#8217;ve found about a hundred
writers covering media issues, food, beer, film, television and soccer
to follow on Twitter and to keep me abreast of the news and ideas of the
day. Particularly for a news junkie, it&amp;#8217;s a great&amp;nbsp;advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve gotten more comfortable with the service, I&amp;#8217;ve experimented with
a couple of Twitter management programs that help me more easily handle
the onslaught of information. &lt;a href="http://seesmic.com/"&gt;Seesmic&lt;/a&gt; has a half-decent app for
Android phones, but I&amp;#8217;ve settled on using &lt;a href="http://hootsuite.com/"&gt;Hootsuite&lt;/a&gt; (also on Sree&amp;#8217;s
advice). It&amp;#8217;s got a great web interface that allows you to manage not
only Twitter, but also LinkedIn, Facebook and Myspace accounts, and its
Android app is easy and&amp;nbsp;attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re curious about this whole Twitter phenomenon in particular, I&amp;#8217;d
recommend checking out Sree&amp;#8217;s podcasts and then peruse his
exhaustive &lt;a href="http://sreetips.tumblr.com/post/87435969/twitter"&gt;Twitter guide for skeptics and newbies&lt;/a&gt;. If you decide to
sign up (or if you&amp;#8217;re already there), let me know so that I can start
following your work&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leave a comment below or follow me on Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/ultracasual/" title="Tweet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@ultracasual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;and
tell me what tools you&amp;#8217;ve found useful in navigating the social&amp;nbsp;mediasphere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2010 08:02:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2010-05-05:blog/2010/05/diving-headfirst-into-the-social-media-deep-end.html</guid></item><item><title>The ups and downs of the younger, faster, busier newsroom</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2010/01/the-up-and-down-sides-of-the-younger-faster-busier-newsroom.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Things have been pretty hectic over the last year. The Local News
Service is fully staffed and running at full steam. Over the summer, we
had a baby. Between the two, I&amp;#8217;ve had my hands&amp;nbsp;full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I was invited to speak on a panel to address the
faculty at Columbia University&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/"&gt;Graduate School of Journalism&lt;/a&gt;. It
gave me the opportunity to reflect on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; first 10 months of operation
and what I&amp;#8217;ve learned. Here&amp;#8217;s a draft of my scripted&amp;nbsp;remarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#8217;s changing, and what isn&amp;#8217;t, in newsrooms&amp;nbsp;today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start first with a little bit of background, because I get a
lot of questions about what the Local News Service is and how it&amp;#8217;s
related to the&amp;nbsp;Star-Ledger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the Star-Ledger lost about 45 percent of its staff through a
massive buyout. Its parent company, &lt;a href="http://www.advance.net/index.ssf?/advance_publications/about_advance_publications.html"&gt;Advance Publications&lt;/a&gt;, decided
to set up a separate company to provide local news. This was not
unprecedented. For years, the Ledger&amp;#8217;s high school sports and
obituaries have been done &lt;a href="http://www.oldnewark.com/memories/newspapers/reporter/footnoteone.htm"&gt;by an outside outfit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.njlns.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was launched last year to create a new cost structure and to
fill the local pages of the &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/starledger/"&gt;Star-Ledger&lt;/a&gt; and its website,
&lt;a href="http://www.nj.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a newsroom of 15 reporters and 3 photographers covering
municipal, local and breaking news in the six core counties of the
Star-Ledger&amp;#8217;s coverage area. Three experienced editors, including
myself and Rick Everett (retired Star-Ledger managing editor), offer
direction, context and&amp;nbsp;guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an additional nine or 10 staffers who produce 26 listing
calendars a week as well as community news items, Scouting and schools
news and a history&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our purpose is to produce more content for print and online with
fewer, less experienced journalists. At the same time, we want to
maintain the same quality and standards that readers expect of the
state&amp;#8217;s biggest newspaper. And we&amp;#8217;ve done just that. Our photographers
and reporters produce a ton of copy. We have helped bolster the
Ledger&amp;#8217;s zoned county sections, and on occasion, we&amp;#8217;ve contributed
stories to the features, business and sports sections. And while our
primary objective is local news, we&amp;#8217;ve also snagged 27 front page
stories and probably twice as many Jersey section cover pieces since
we went live in&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I&amp;#8217;ve observed a few&amp;nbsp;things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition is changing. Our old enemies have become our new
friends as we join to fight new enemies. We now compete online with
dozens of hyperlocal websites (&lt;a href="http://www.patch.com"&gt;Patch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.baristanet.com/"&gt;Baristanet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.maplewoodonline.com/"&gt;Maplewood
Online&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://maplewood.blogs.nytimes.com/"&gt;The Local&lt;/a&gt;, etc) as well as our old print foes from the
Gannett papers. At the same time, the Ledger has largely buried the
hatchet with its old rival the Bergen &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com"&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt;, and they now share
most stories and have a combined statehouse bureau in&amp;nbsp;Trenton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is faster. When we get a breaking news tip, we want to get
it confirmed and get a short version of the story online immediately,
if not sooner. The pace is picking&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our news gatherers are young. Only one of the 15 we hired was over 30.
This has resulted in the loss of some institutional memory. In many
cases, the veterans who had been in the Ledger&amp;#8217;s county bureaus for
decades are gone. Some are now working as spokesmen for various state
and local agencies and private companies. But they have been replaced,
by and large, by ambitious and energetic reporters who know little to
nothing about New Jersey and its stories. It has been a challenge for
us to fill those gaps while our reporters cover, in some cases, 10 or
more&amp;nbsp;towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our reporters are sophisticated Web consumers and are
comfortable with blogging, Facebook, shooting photos and even
producing videos, there is no replacement for basic reporting skills.
The most important thing I need from a new reporter is the ability to
ask questions and chase a story. It does me no good if you can make a
sound slide or build a web page if you can&amp;#8217;t find a story, ask
questions and get it right. I&amp;#8217;ve also noticed that as great as it is,
Google has almost grown too popular. I have a reporter who rather than
check the Star-Ledger&amp;#8217;s own, comprehensive online archives when
looking for old clips, she will instead just Google it and see what
hits come up from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;.com. She doesn&amp;#8217;t even go to her own website to
look for&amp;nbsp;stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this turmoil and change has been a very tough transition for
readers. Our sources, particularly our favorite gadflies and midlevel
local bureaucrats, have found this very confusing. They had been used
to, in many cases, dealing with the same reporters for a decade or
more. They knew who to call when there was news. Now they don&amp;#8217;t know
who covers what. We have gone to great lengths to get our name out
there. We&amp;#8217;ve sent our reporters to as many meetings and events as we
can in our towns to schmooze residents and officials and explain we&amp;#8217;re
a new operation and get our faces out&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is, however, exciting. We have a great time doing what we
do. Our reporters, because they haven&amp;#8217;t been poisoned by the malaise
that afflicts many news organizations, really enjoy their jobs. We
have fun going into work every day and chasing the news. We get
excited when one of our people gets a front page&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, even as business models evolve, the work we do as
journalists every day hasn&amp;#8217;t changed all that much. We have better
tools to work with in some cases, and we&amp;#8217;ve got to do more, faster,
but at the end of the day, it&amp;#8217;s journalism. I couldn&amp;#8217;t be&amp;nbsp;happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2010 09:36:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2010-01-23:blog/2010/01/the-up-and-down-sides-of-the-younger-faster-busier-newsroom.html</guid></item><item><title>Moving on</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2009/04/moving-on.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As with many things on this site, it&amp;#8217;s taken me a little while to get
around to posting this&amp;nbsp;note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, after a very successful stint at the Herald News&amp;#8212;which
included helping to lead it to win the award for best small daily in the
state from the &lt;a href="http://njpa.org/njpa/better_newspaper_contest/2008/2008%20Editorial%20Results%20-%20Daily.pdf"&gt;New Jersey Press Association&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;I left to join a
start-up newsroom. (Alas, I also left behind my neglected soccer blog)
Now I am one of the news editors at the New Jersey Local News Service.
Owned by &lt;a href="http://www.advance.net/index.ssf?/advance_publications/about_advance_publications.html"&gt;Advance Publications&lt;/a&gt;, we have a team of 15 reporters who
cover municipal beats across six counties here in the Garden&amp;nbsp;State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, as part of &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2008/09/10/back-to-school/"&gt;my fellowship&lt;/a&gt; at Fairleigh Dickinson,
I&amp;#8217;ve been taking a course this spring on Web programming, specifically
with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;.net. I&amp;#8217;ve also been lucky enough to play a good amount of
soccer and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ&lt;/span&gt; a couple of times with&amp;nbsp;friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when many newspapers are convulsing or collapsing, working for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNS&lt;/span&gt; has been a really unique opportunity to help build a news gathering
outfit from the ground up. We provide all of our stories to the Newark
Star-Ledger and its Web site &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;.com&lt;/a&gt;. So far, we&amp;#8217;ve been having a
blast. I have a feeling that we&amp;#8217;re going to see more news organizations
following this model: start an outside company to focus intensely on
local news and provide content for print and online. It&amp;#8217;ll be great to
set the precedent for how it can be&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2009 11:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2009-04-21:blog/2009/04/moving-on.html</guid></item><item><title>CSCI6844 Homework 5</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2009/04/csci6844-homework-5.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Dr.&amp;nbsp;An,&lt;/p&gt;

cycle has been a bear&amp;nbsp;lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Passaic County, we got hit by a major news story last week, and
in the process of overseeing our coverage, I rediscovered a fantastic
resource I wanted to&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 23, a gunman walked into a Syrian Orthodox Church in Clifton,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;N.J.&lt;/span&gt; looking for his estranged wife. Police say the man shot three
people in their heads before he fled, killing his wife and another
parishioner and critically injuring his wife&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a sad story, and our coverage on that Sunday and in the
&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/United_by_faith_fate.html"&gt;subsequent days&lt;/a&gt; revealed a small, tight-knit &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/Sect_sees_arranged_marriages_as_vital.html"&gt;community of
Christians&lt;/a&gt; here that is made up predominantly of immigrants from the
southern Indian state of Kerala. (Unfortunately, the relaunch of our Web
site this week wiped out about six other stories we wrote)&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/Sect_sees_arranged_marriages_as_vital.html"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty quickly after the shootings, parishioners who were in the church
gave our reporters the name of the man they thought was the shooter (and
&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/Accused_church_killer_due_in_court.html"&gt;who was arraigned in court today&lt;/a&gt;). I found his phone number in
California, and we called it. The woman who answered the phone didn&amp;#8217;t
speak English, only malayalam, the language used in Kerala. I wondered
how I could find a translator on a Sunday&amp;nbsp;evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I remembered that for the past four years I&amp;#8217;ve been a member of the
&lt;a href="http://www.saja.org/"&gt;South Asian Journalists Association&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAJA&lt;/span&gt;. I was ashamed I didn&amp;#8217;t
think of it sooner. So I sent an e-mail to another member looking for
help. Within 15 minutes, I got a phone call from someone willing to do
some on-the-fly translation through a conference&amp;nbsp;call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we called California again, perhaps unsurprisingly, no one
answered. But I was pleased by the help that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAJA&lt;/span&gt; was willing to offer.
Then one of its members &lt;a href="http://www.sajaforum.org/2008/11/crime-fatal-shootings-at-kerala-church-in-nj.html#comments"&gt;posted about our story&lt;/a&gt; on the group&amp;#8217;s South
Asian issues blog, &lt;a href="http://www.sajaforum.org/"&gt;SAJAforum&lt;/a&gt;. The comments that the forum&amp;#8217;s readers
left in response to the story helped our staff members find new avenues
of reporting in the following days. It was an indescribable&amp;nbsp;boon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was truly impressed with the resources &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAJA&lt;/span&gt; had assembled and the
collegiality and professionalism of its members as they offered advice
and help with our story. I was sold on renewing my&amp;nbsp;membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a couple days later, the &lt;a href="http://www.sajaforum.org/mumbai-attacks/"&gt;terrorist attacks in Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; happened.
Since then, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAJA&lt;/span&gt; has gone into overdrive. SAJAforum has offered loads of
tips, including daily podcasts and phonecasts. With its coverage of this
event, SAJAforum has proven itself an indispensable resource for anyone
seriously covering South Asian news, both here and abroad. I can&amp;#8217;t
recommend it&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2008 13:15:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2008-12-05:blog/2008/12/all-eyes-on-india.html</guid></item><item><title>Getting social networked</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2008/11/getting-social-networked.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After years of hearing about it and after months of hearing friends and
loved ones raving about it, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to take the plunge and explore
&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In years past, I had flirted with &lt;a href="http://www.friendster.com/"&gt;Friendster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com"&gt;Myspace&lt;/a&gt; with
varying degrees of interest. But Facebook seems to be the juggernaut
that is outpacing all its competitors. So I&amp;#8217;ve begun to set up a profile
and nose around it. Here&amp;#8217;s my question for you, my small cadre of
readers: Once you&amp;#8217;re signed up on Facebook, what do you do with&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, there are only so many long-lost college classmates to track
down. And once we ascertain that we both exist in cyberspace and
exchange some pleasantries, then what? What&amp;#8217;s your favorite thing about&amp;nbsp;Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once you&amp;#8217;ve built your social network, what do you think is the best
use for&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love to hear your thoughts and&amp;nbsp;advice.&lt;/p&gt;

world of futbol&lt;/a&gt;, keeps me more than busy much of the time. Thus, this
little professional blog ends up taking a back seat until the spirit
moves&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#8217;s been awhile, and summer has already sprinted past us, but
here&amp;#8217;s a quick update. Now that school&amp;#8217;s back in session, I have one
more responsibility to add to my plate. This semester, I&amp;#8217;m the North
Jersey Media Group fellow at &lt;a href="http://www.fdu.edu/"&gt;Fairleigh Dickinson University&lt;/a&gt;. As part
of the fellowship, I&amp;#8217;m teaching &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/dataclass/"&gt;an introductory course in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for
students at the campus that straddles &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackensack_River"&gt;the lazy Hackensack River&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semester has barely begun, but so far I&amp;#8217;m enjoying working with my
tiny class. The students seem curious and eager to learn about working
with Excel and databases, even if it&amp;#8217;s not quite clear to them yet what
to do with it all. I think this will be a good chance for me to practice
my classroom demeanor. And hopefully it&amp;#8217;ll give me the impetus to make
some more headway on fleshing out the &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/best-practices/"&gt;Best Practices&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What advice do you have for me as I strive to teach the next generation
of journalists and&amp;nbsp;writers?&lt;/p&gt;

for teaching and learning &lt;a href="http://www.nicar.org/"&gt;computer-assisted reporting&lt;/a&gt;. I am

and media in the middle of the 20th Century. &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7096480"&gt;The Race Beat&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; not
only chronicles the coverage of the civil rights movement and its
effects on American society, it offers a few good lessons on being a&amp;nbsp;journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my&amp;nbsp;favorite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;One other thing made &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/weta/reportingamericaatwar/reporters/bigart/"&gt;Bigart&lt;/a&gt; memorable: he spoke with a stammer
that colleagues frequently saw him use to his benefit to coax
information from reluctant&amp;nbsp;sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/11547/index1.html"&gt;Lelyveld&lt;/a&gt;, sent to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Civil_Rights_Workers_Murders"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; after Bigart, met a local
minister, introduced himself, and interviewed the minister. He came
away with an unforgettable lesson in what it takes to be a great
newspaper&amp;nbsp;reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8216;You&amp;#8217;ve asked me a lot of questions,&amp;#8217; the minister said in a buttery
southern accent after the interview was over. &amp;#8216;Can I ask you&amp;nbsp;one?&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8216;Yes sir&amp;#8217;, Lelyveld&amp;nbsp;responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8216;There was a man down here, an older man, said &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; was from &lt;a href="http://www.southerner.net/v1n3_99/gaytalese.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The
New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Name of Bigaht. Know&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;im?&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8216;Yes&amp;nbsp;sir.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8216;Couldn&amp;#8217;t have a normal conversation with that man,&amp;#8217; the minister
went on. &amp;#8216;He didn&amp;#8217;t know anything. I had to explain
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;evvvverything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to&amp;nbsp;him.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a bad &lt;span class="caps"&gt;M.O.&lt;/span&gt; if you can pull it off.

Dad!), I have good news. The Herald News&amp;#8217; soccer writer, &lt;a href="http://www.soccerbyives.net"&gt;Ives
Galarcep&lt;/a&gt;, has gone rogue and left the paper to start his own soccer
media empire. Since his departure, I have been tapped to write our
paper&amp;#8217;s soccer blog. Last week, we launched &lt;a href="http://www.myheraldnews.com/fixture"&gt;The International
Fixture&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a chance for me to write about the culture and passion
of soccer&amp;#8217;s players and supporters. The blog will hopefully focus on the
game around the world and how it resonates with people in the North
Jersey and New York City&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#8217;re at all interested in the beautiful game, stop by and check
it out. It&amp;#8217;s a hobby that I&amp;#8217;ll try to squeeze in when my regular editing
responsibilities allow, but I think it will be a fun chance to write
about one of my favorite pasttimes. We&amp;#8217;ll see how it&amp;nbsp;goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who aren&amp;#8217;t soccer aficionados, don&amp;#8217;t despair. I&amp;#8217;ll keep
sharing my tips and experiences in the newspaper business here on my
personal site, as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2008 06:32:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2008-04-09:blog/2008/04/the-kick-off.html</guid></item><item><title>Free Barry Bearak</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2008/04/free-barry-bearak.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time, you read about journalists being imprisoned in
far-off countries for doing their jobs. Only rarely do you recognize
their&amp;nbsp;names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Barry Bearak of the New York Times was arrested in Zimbabwe
and accused of  &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://http://www.cpj.org/news/2008/africa/zim04apr08na2.html"&gt;practicing journalism without accreditation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. I
made Bearak&amp;#8217;s acquaintance a few years ago when he was teaching at
Columbia University&amp;#8217;s journalism school. I&amp;#8217;ve since become a fan of his
work. He&amp;#8217;s a gifted and probing writer who has won the Pulitzer Prize,
the highest honor in American&amp;nbsp;journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard about Bearak&amp;#8217;s arrest this morning on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;. I can&amp;#8217;t profess
to know all the ins and outs of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/world/africa/04zimbabwe.html?_r=1&amp;amp;st=cse&amp;amp;sq=bearak&amp;amp;scp=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;situation in Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;, but I
know that Bearak is a journalist of integrity. I hope that Barry is safe
and sound and released&amp;nbsp;quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s an outrage that any government would jail a journalist for doing
his job. A lot of people like to grouse about the American news media
and accuse it of rampant bias. But situations like these only reinforce
how vital an unfettered press is to a true&amp;nbsp;democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/world/africa/08bearak.html?_r=1&amp;amp;scp=2&amp;amp;sq=bearak&amp;amp;st=nyt&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;Bearak was freed on bail Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, his case will
help shine a light on the persecution of journalists and restrictions on
the free flow of information in Zimbabwe. Maybe that light can help the
people there make a&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2008 19:13:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2008-04-04:blog/2008/04/free-barry-bearak.html</guid></item><item><title>Note to self</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2008/04/note-to-self.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Before attending a job fair to interview journalism students and
aspiring reporters, be sure to update your Web site. Reporters these
days know &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/best-practices/google-search/"&gt;how to Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When feasible, finish updating the &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/best-practices/"&gt;Best Practices&lt;/a&gt; section of this&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a deep breath, and enjoy&amp;nbsp;spring.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2008 12:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2008-04-02:blog/2008/04/note-to-self.html</guid></item><item><title>Learning to be a journalist</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2008/03/learning-to-be-a-journalist.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Some people spend years trying to learn our craft, spending thousands on
graduate schools. Others just go where the news is, roll up their
sleeves and give it a&amp;nbsp;shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t say that my friend David Lang&amp;#8217;s method is the best way to get
into the business, but it&amp;#8217;s not the craziest either. &lt;a href="http://davidlang.blogspot.com/"&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; is an
accomplished photographer who has been learning the craft of making
pictures for some time, but this winter he went out on a limb. He flew
to Pakistan for a month to cover the presidential elections there and to
explore&amp;nbsp;Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, camera and lights in hand, David is having a hell of an
adventure, and he&amp;#8217;s no longer just a documentary photographer. He&amp;#8217;s a
journalist. &lt;a href="http://davidlang.blogspot.com/"&gt;His blog&lt;/a&gt; about his experiences in the &amp;#8216;stans is
funny, engaging and definitely worth a read. I have a feeling we&amp;#8217;ll all
be seeing much more of&lt;a href="http://www.davidlang.com/main.php"&gt;his work&lt;/a&gt;soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2008 18:38:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2008-03-07:blog/2008/03/learning-to-be-a-journalist.html</guid></item><item><title>Maslow mourned</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2008/02/maslow-mourned.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, we lost &lt;a href="http://www.myheraldnews.com/view.html?type=stories&amp;amp;action=detail&amp;amp;sub_id=27821"&gt;a colleague and an accomplished journalist&lt;/a&gt; when
Jonathan Maslow&amp;nbsp;died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of &lt;a href="http://www.theenergyindependent.com/jonathan-evan-maslow/jonathan-evan-maslow-1948-2008.html"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="http://www.capemaycountyherald.com/article/21803-former-herald-reporter-jonathan-e-maslow-59"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; shared their memories and their
sadness &lt;a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080220/journalism-mourns-a-loss/"&gt;much better&lt;/a&gt; than I can. All I&amp;#8217;ll say is that his humor and
his passion for life and the newsman&amp;#8217;s craft will be sorely missed in
this newsroom. And those traits are desperately needed in so many&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2008 19:25:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2008-02-21:blog/2008/02/maslow-mourned.html</guid></item><item><title>Must crawl before walking.</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2008/01/must-crawl-before-walking.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been putting off posting here for weeks, hoping inspiration would
strike, or I would suddenly find a bounty of free time to think of
something really&amp;nbsp;insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this happened, so I&amp;#8217;ll drop a few tidbits of news and links to
some friends, and hope I can get things rolling here again&amp;nbsp;shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;#8217;m no longer &lt;a href="http://www.myheraldnews.com/"&gt;my paper&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt; reporter. Last month, I was
promoted to city editor. I can just hear you, in your best &lt;a href="http://www.gotwavs.com/php/sounds/?id=gog&amp;amp;media=WAVS&amp;amp;type=Movies&amp;amp;movie=Big_Lebowski&amp;amp;quote=achievers.txt&amp;amp;file=achievers.wav"&gt;Maude
Lebowski tone&lt;/a&gt;, saying to yourself &amp;#8220;And proud we are of you&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;. Yes,
it&amp;#8217;s a nice new job to throw me back at the bottom of a steep learning
curve. Thankfully, some friends have been giving me &lt;a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080108/a-crowdsourcing-experiment/"&gt;some advice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the time being, let me just say I promise to post again soon.
There&amp;#8217;s loads of cool and exciting things happening on the Web that
should make journalists &lt;a href="http://www.wiredjournalists.com"&gt;informed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.everyblock.com"&gt;nervous&lt;/a&gt;(in a good way, like
a roller-coaster ride). They should keep you busy for a&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let me pass on a couple of old nuggets from a former editor: &lt;a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20071214/agoraphobics-in-your-newsroom/"&gt;get
out of the newsroom&lt;/a&gt;, and use your e-mail addressbook as &lt;a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080113/newsletters-your-secret-to-developing-sources/"&gt;a way to
cultivate sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So stop obsessing over this season of &amp;#8220;The Wire&amp;#8221; and step up your game,
people. I&amp;#8217;m trying&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2008 18:29:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2008-01-24:blog/2008/01/must-crawl-before-walking.html</guid></item><item><title>There’s always room for another two cents.</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/12/theres-always-room-for-another-two-cents.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;While I use &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/"&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt; fairly regularly&amp;#8212;particularly its e-mailed
news alerts), I never noticed the new &amp;#8220;comments from people in the news&amp;#8221;
function that it apparently launched last spring. It&amp;#8217;s a fascinating
idea that the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/24/business/media/24link.html?_r=2&amp;amp;ref=technology&amp;amp;oref=login&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Times&lt;/a&gt; recently took a look at (thanks, &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/26/1246246&amp;amp;from=rss"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;
for bringing it to my&amp;nbsp;attention).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s set aside for a moment the daunting challenges of trying to make
this work in the real world. Why shouldn&amp;#8217;t news subjects have a chance
to comment on a story in which they appear, particularly on the Web
where the column inches are infinite? Certainly sources have already
taken advantage of the comment functions that many news organizations&amp;#8217;
Web sites already employ. But Google has hit upon a unique twist by
weighting the comments from those quoted in a story. The journalist has
already gone to the effort of vetting sources and weeding out those with
less substantial thoughts to add to a story. To give them a chance to
comment after the fact and append it to the story can only add to the
depth of the&amp;nbsp;coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s conceivable that you could give every source you interview a
special &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; and a password. Once the story appears in the paper, they
could then choose to login and sound off. It would assuage the bruised
egos of those long-winded subjects who inevitably lose much of their
argument to brevity. It would also keep reporters on their toes that
they could expect more than a nasty letter to the editor should they
play fast and loose with the&amp;nbsp;facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Is there any reason we as journalists couldn&amp;#8217;t (or
shouldn&amp;#8217;t) provide such a function on our own Web sites? Or should we
let Google have all the&amp;nbsp;fun?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2007 20:43:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-12-28:blog/2007/12/theres-always-room-for-another-two-cents.html</guid></item><item><title>Uhhh, sorry?</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/12/uhhh-sorry.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My former colleague &lt;a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/"&gt;Yoni Greenbaum&lt;/a&gt; has entered the journalism
blogging arena, and he recently added his &lt;a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/?p=64"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; about the
obligation of newspapers to make their corrections as easy to find
online as they are in the print&amp;nbsp;edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a longtime fan of &lt;a href="http://www.regrettheerror.com/"&gt;Regret the Error&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn&amp;#8217;t agree more. Look,
nobody wants to make a mistake, particularly when reporters, editors and
photographers have spent months on an investigation. A silly bit of
carelessness can sully the credibility of the entire story. But what
would be even more damaging for the journalists involved, and
particularly for their newspaper, would be to soft-pedal the needed&amp;nbsp;correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get it wrong, say so. Say it soon and say it straightforward.
Being forthright with readers about any errors&amp;#8212;of omission or
otherwise&amp;#8212;will reap dividends in the&amp;nbsp;long-run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As newspapers build up more vigorous online presences, it only becomes
more vital that they revisit their correction policies for their Web
editions. Make it visible and be honest, and you will build even more
loyalty for your product. A little &lt;em&gt;mea culpa&lt;/em&gt; will go a long&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2007 16:18:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-12-17:blog/2007/12/uhhh-sorry.html</guid></item><item><title>Editing ‘Saints of the Storm’</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/11/editing-saints-of-the-storm.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been out of the daily reporting loop for months now as I fill in as
an editor, but I have been involved in one cool project. One of my
reporters is now in the Dominican Republic reporting &lt;a href="http://myheraldnews.com/saints.html"&gt;a project&lt;/a&gt; on
the destruction caused earlier in the month by Hurricane Noel. While
she&amp;#8217;s there (without a laptop, cellphone charger or camera cord&amp;#8212;&amp;#8221;lost&amp;#8221;
by the airline), I&amp;#8217;m editing her copy and coordinating the project with
the Web, photo, copy and marketing&amp;nbsp;staffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday she was in the town of Piedra Blanca, an agricultural outpost
of about 23,000 people that was devastated by the storm. Paterson, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;
has the highest population of Dominicans in the state and many of our
readers hail from Piedra Blanca. They led Heather to this great&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We&amp;#8217;re starting at zero,&amp;#8221; said Dr. Carmen Garcia, the mayor of Piedra
Blanca, while sitting in her sparse office on Tuesday. &amp;#8220;This destroyed&amp;nbsp;everything.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/dr"&gt;The series&lt;/a&gt; will drop the next stories on Saturday and Monday with
more to follow next week. It will be definitely worth a read if you&amp;#8217;re
interested in how new Americans return home to help their countrymen in&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of juggling all the demands of launching this project
yesterday, I did get to do a piece of data reporting. I actually managed
to squeeze in an opportunity to run some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; queries on a New Jersey
accidents database for a reporter looking for some key data. She was
looking for the number of accidents involving school buses in Passaic
County over the last five years. I was quite pleased with myself that I
could run the queries and find her answer in about 15 minutes. The
number?&amp;nbsp;713.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2007 15:48:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-11-21:blog/2007/11/editing-saints-of-the-storm.html</guid></item><item><title>“Hilarious”, no sarcasm intended</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/10/hilarious-no-sarcasm-intended.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of my grammatical pet peeves is the abuse of quotation marks. I see
it often in my daily life, but as I&amp;#8217;ve been editing lately, I&amp;#8217;ve noticed
it popping up more and more in the stories I coach. A lot of young
reporters think that quoting just one word an official says lends their
story some kind of credibility. What they fail to realize is that the
technique has the opposite effect. It either confuses the reader or
suggests that the writer intends to use the quote&amp;nbsp;sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was thrilled this morning when I discovered (through the help of
the ever-resourceful &lt;a href="http://www.depthreporting.com/"&gt;Depth Reporting&lt;/a&gt;) the &lt;a href="http://quotation-marks.blogspot.com/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Blog&amp;#8221; of &amp;#8220;unnecessary&amp;#8221;
quotation marks&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully this will help me make my argument that
it&amp;#8217;s often better to avoid the gratuitous quotation marks as if they

&lt;p&gt;There are two skills that I believe are now indispensable in the field.
Any journalist who won&amp;#8217;t begin to embrace them is simply not ready for
the future of the business. What are they? Computer-assisted reporting
and Spanish (or any other second language, for that&amp;nbsp;matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few news organizations or journalism programs have invested
resources into teaching their journalists these skills. How are you
supposed to learn them, then? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has the time or money to attend one of &lt;a href="http://www.ire.org/training/otr.php"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s excellent
training sessions&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully people like my colleague Christopher
Schnaars at &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com"&gt;The Record&lt;/a&gt; have pulled together some resources for you
to learn on your own (&lt;em&gt;stage whisper: thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.depthreporting.com/2007/10/free-excel-training-course-at-reporters.html"&gt;Depth Reporting&lt;/a&gt; for
pointing this out&lt;/em&gt;). Schnaars has a great, &lt;a href="http://www.forjournalists.com/cookbook/media/ExcelTraining.zip"&gt;four-part course&lt;/a&gt; on
learning to use the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program. This is not
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4sOFVAR87I"&gt;C++ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; programming&lt;/a&gt;. These are basic skills that every reporter in
the newsroom can and should master. Do yourself a favor and work through
Schnaar&amp;#8217;s lessons. You&amp;#8217;ll find them endlessly helpful in your reporting
and editing. If you want to keep going after that, then the &lt;a href="http://forjournalists.com/cookbook/index.php?title=Main_Page"&gt;Reporter&amp;#8217;s
Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; will point you to the help you&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#8217;ve got the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt; skills, and now I&amp;#8217;m turning my attention to
learning a new language. Thank you, &lt;a href="http://www.clifton.k12.nj.us/adulteducation.asp"&gt;Clifton High School&amp;#8217;s adult
education night classes&lt;/a&gt;. You should look at night schools and
community colleges in your area for similarly-affordable options. I&amp;#8217;m
about a third of the way through an elementary Spanish class. To gauge
my progress, you can see this short exchange I wrote&amp;nbsp;myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;¿Como esta?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;#8220;No rapido, pero de&amp;nbsp;acuerda.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my very, very rudimentary Spanish is off the mark, which it likely
is, allow me to&amp;nbsp;translate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;How is it?&amp;#8221; (meaning my progress in learning Spanish)&lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;#8220;Not fast, but&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve got to learn to walk before you can run. Good&amp;nbsp;luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2007 16:52:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-10-19:blog/2007/10/two-skills-for-the-future.html</guid></item><item><title>“My dog is better than yours”</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/10/my-dog-is-better-than-yours.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;From the shameless self-promotion department, here&amp;#8217;s a couple of nice
stories we ran this weekend that I had a hand&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of months, I&amp;#8217;ve been editing full-time, so I haven&amp;#8217;t
had a lot of bylines of late. But my &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2MCZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5NzIwMTM1MSZ5cmlyeTdmNzE3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTI="&gt;latest project&lt;/a&gt;, which I put
together in conjunction with our intrepid cops reporter, looks at the
worst intersections in our county for&amp;nbsp;pedestrians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started when I found that the New Jersey Department of
Transportation posts all of its &lt;a href="http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/"&gt;crash records&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;the databases listing
every accident in the state in which a report was filed&amp;#8212;online. We took
a look at the last six years to see what intersections have proved most
dangerous, and deadly, for walkers and cyclists. Once I got the data,
the hardest part was figuring out how to standardize the names of the
intersections. One accident might be listed at Main and Market streets.
The next accident would be listed at Market and Main streets, but
they&amp;#8217;re really the same interesction. &lt;a href="http://www.ire.org/membersonly/lists/NICAR-L/2007-07/msg00174.html"&gt;With a little help&lt;/a&gt; from the
everready &lt;a href="http://nicar.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NICAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; listserv, I leapt over that hurdle and kept&amp;nbsp;running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the state &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s formula for weighting the severity of each
accident. Those with more serious injuries got a higher score. Those
with a complaint of pain or simply property damage got a very low score.
Then we just added up the scores for every accident at each
intersection. Pretty straightforward, although it took us some time to
pull it all&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product, a nice explainer piece for our readers, ran Sunday. Judging
by the early chatter on the local message boards, forums and blogs, it
seemed to get a good response from readers. It was accompanied by a
cool&lt;a href="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.northjersey.com/dngmedia/media_server/hn/2007/09/30pedestrians/index.html','_blank','width=600,height=485,status=1,scrollbars=0,resizable=0'));"&gt;sound slides&lt;/a&gt; that we put together with the help of our photo
staff. Of course, there was also the de rigeur&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/static/maps/092307intersectionsmap.html"&gt;Google map&lt;/a&gt; showing the
clusters of the worst intersections and highlighting the 12 where
pedestrians have been killed by drivers since 2001.&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/static/maps/092307intersectionsmap.html"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, this morning, we ran a project that I had coached and edited from
the beginning on the &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzNTkmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTcyMDIzNjYmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXky"&gt;dogfighting&lt;/a&gt; underworld in New Jersey. Despite
the headlines generated by Michael Vick&amp;#8217;s arrest and downfall over the
summer, very few outlets really took the time to understand the allure
of dogfighting and related blood sports like&amp;nbsp;cockfighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporter Heather Haddon spent weeks cultivating sources to do just that,
to get into the dogfighting landscape that is surprisingly popular here
and to explain why thousands of people are attracted to it. I think she
did a great job. I hope you&amp;nbsp;agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think of these projects. Any reactions? Criticisms?&amp;nbsp;Advice?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2007 11:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-10-01:blog/2007/10/my-dog-is-better-than-yours.html</guid></item><item><title>A browser for data?</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/09/a-browser-for-data.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A friend just alerted me to &lt;a href="http://www.kirix.com/"&gt;Kirix Strata&lt;/a&gt;, a Web browser that will
let you work with raw data as you see it on your favorite Web pages. You
can easily manipulate html tables or create mash-ups with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds.
This is an intriguing idea. I wonder if, like &lt;a href="http://blog.swivel.com/"&gt;Swivel&lt;/a&gt; (another
new-fangled Internet contraption I haven&amp;#8217;t had the time to really
explore yet), this will help democratize data&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Of course, &lt;a href="http://www.depthreporting.com/2007/08/web-data-browser.html"&gt;Depth Reporting&lt;/a&gt; had this tidbit more than a month ago,
but I must have missed that post the first time&amp;nbsp;around.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These discoveries led me to a few&amp;nbsp;questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have any of you had a chance to use either Kirix Strata or&amp;nbsp;Swivel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have you been able to do with these tools and would you
    recommend them for a harried journalist working with&amp;nbsp;data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What pointers can you share to help a newbie get the most out of
    these&amp;nbsp;applications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love to hear any feedback you have. Post a comment and let me know
what you&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2007 07:37:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-09-26:blog/2007/09/a-browser-for-data.html</guid></item><item><title>Insert bad Cyndi Lauper pun here</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/09/insert-bad-cyndi-lauper-pun-here.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Although you probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t know it from the miniscule bit of
coverage it has received thus far, the Women&amp;#8217;s World Cup (of soccer) is
currently underway in China. Since I don&amp;#8217;t have cable at home, and the
games have been broadcast in the middle of the night, I&amp;#8217;m sad to say I
haven&amp;#8217;t seen any of the play beyond the usual highlight clips on&amp;nbsp;YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have been very interested in the small bit of very good writing
about the tournament that has made its way back here. &lt;a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/"&gt;Steve Goff of the
Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; made the trip to China to follow the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Women&amp;#8217;s
National Team&amp;#8217;s exploits there, in the process offering a window into
the East that we rarely&amp;nbsp;get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories that have captured my attention the most thus far are those
that show the inequities that exist in world football. Even though few
people really support the Americans here, they are the best team on the
planet (rivaled perhaps only by Germany and, now, &lt;a href="http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/the-selecao-feminina-from-no-respect-to-saviours-of-their-country/"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;). Other
nations treat their women&amp;#8217;s teams the same way Americans treat all
professional soccer&amp;#8212;like a second-class sport fit only for the Third&amp;nbsp;World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the best story I&amp;#8217;ve seen on the growing pains of women&amp;#8217;s
football around the globe illustrates that better than most. It came in
this excellent &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu1CrkrQV_Q&amp;amp;mode=related&amp;amp;search="&gt;Al-Jazeera English piece&lt;/a&gt; on the slow rise of women&amp;#8217;s
soccer in Egypt (thanks to the
late-to-the-game-but-increasingly-great&lt;a href="http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/"&gt;Goal blog&lt;/a&gt;by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Times for
the clip). Perhaps it&amp;#8217;s unsurprising that no teams from the Middle East
made it to China for this year&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Women will face off against the Brazilian Samba Queens
Thursday in the Cup&amp;#8217;s semi-finals. A win against Brazil (nearly
unthinkable for the men&amp;#8217;s squad), and the team will book a slot in the
finals, likely against its nemesis Germany. I think there&amp;#8217;s really no
downside to the expanding popularity, and skill, of the women&amp;#8217;s game.
But as Steve Goff &lt;a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/2007/09/world_cup_prize_money.html"&gt;reported today&lt;/a&gt; the glass ceiling isn&amp;#8217;t just an
obstacle for women in corporate America. The winners of the Women&amp;#8217;s
World Cup will receive a mere fraction of the prize money that the
Italian men took home last&amp;nbsp;summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As entertaining as the games in China may be, we&amp;#8217;ve still got a long way
to&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2007 19:43:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-09-25:blog/2007/09/insert-bad-cyndi-lauper-pun-here.html</guid></item><item><title>“Let’s get this thing rolling.”</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/09/lets-get-this-thing-rolling.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I once heard an editor compare working in New Jersey to hunting in a
game preserve. Much like their cousins in &lt;a href="http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt;, Jersey
politicians never cease to provide a wealth of good&amp;nbsp;stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week or so ago, we got one of those stories when federal investigators
launched &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkyMDA5"&gt;the latest&lt;/a&gt; in their regular series of corruption arrests of&amp;nbsp;politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the dozen or so public officials arrested statewide on charges of
accepting bribes, four come from our coverage area in Passaic County.
Each was accused of taking thousands of dollars&amp;#8212;one was to allegedly
have his bribe wired to an account in the Dominican Republic after being
laundered in Switzerland&amp;#8212;in exchange for arranging municipal insurance
and roofing&amp;nbsp;contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our City Editor departed for the snowy vistas of Minnesota last
month, I&amp;#8217;ve been filling in as an assistant editor on the desk. As this
story broke about 9 a.m. on a Thursday, I got to really sink my teeth
into managing this story. We deployed 11 of our 13 city desk reporters
to cover the news. Then we wrangled another three reporters from the
features desk to lend a&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put out a barrage of stories in Friday&amp;#8217;s paper: from the &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkyMDA4"&gt;reaction of
the constituents&lt;/a&gt; to the immediate &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkxOTUx"&gt;political wrangling&lt;/a&gt; that
erupted over the pending election for the seat of the
Assemblyman/Undersheriff/&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkyMDA4"&gt;Clergyman&lt;/a&gt; who
was arrested. We also had a nice profile of the former professional
wrestler and cop-turned-&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkxOTcy"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; who got caught in the sting. Our lead
piece used some of the text from the federal complaints and wiretaps to
analyze the differing leadership styles of the &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkxOTg2"&gt;two arrested
heavyweights&lt;/a&gt; from our&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then at 3 p.m. on the same day, they shut down the entire school
system in the city of Paterson for &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk0JmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkyMDAz"&gt;fire code violations&lt;/a&gt;. So we had
to scramble two more reporters to handle that&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great rush to work on a big breaking story from the other side
of the assigning desk, moving reporters and resources around to handle
the emerging threads of the news. I got to chip in by doing some
backgrounding of some of the arrested pols, but I didn&amp;#8217;t get to be as
hands-on as I normally would. Thankfully, there will surely be more
stories like this coming down the&amp;nbsp;road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And three days later, while working a weekend shift as a humble
reporter, I finally got my shot to write &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkzNTM2"&gt;a piece of the story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;nbsp;goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2007 13:11:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-09-19:blog/2007/09/lets-get-this-thing-rolling.html</guid></item><item><title>Unwelcome visitors</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/09/unwelcome-visitors.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In this era of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing"&gt;astroturf&lt;/a&gt;, not all readers of the blog

the influence he had (along with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Jack
London, George Orwell and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;J.D.&lt;/span&gt; Salinger) on my early life as a&amp;nbsp;writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the hustle and bustle of daily journalism has once again thwarted my
best&amp;nbsp;intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2007/09/05/941743-today-in-history-sept-5"&gt;50 years ago today&lt;/a&gt;, Kerouac&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;On the Road&amp;#8221; was published. Reading
it as a teenager&amp;#8212;if only I could remember who had first handed me a
copy&amp;#8212;led me on an odyssey of discovering and devouring the subversive,
onomatopoetic &lt;em&gt;oevre&lt;/em&gt; of the Beat Generation and its writers. Since
then, many others have surmounted Kerouac&amp;#8217;s primacy in my pantheon of
literary gods, but I still hold a soft spot for him (and the dozens of
editions of his books I still&amp;nbsp;hoard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1405/1207598353_8ae7e6da0b.jpg?v=0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desire to mimic Kerouac, and his brief stint as a sports reporter,
led me to explore journalism as a&amp;nbsp;career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, my high school English teacher, with his heavy Southern accent and
affinity for heavy suede workboots, spied me reading &amp;#8220;On the Road&amp;#8221;
before class (it was not on the&amp;nbsp;syllabus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Y&amp;#8217;know,&amp;#8221; he said, &amp;#8220;Ol&amp;#8217; Jack drank hi&amp;#8217;self to death back in&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;69.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That teacher turned me on to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;H.L.&lt;/span&gt; Mencken and taught me to write a news&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, I rode my bicycle through Brooklyn and Queens to
visit Kerouac&amp;#8217;s former apartment in Ozone Park. Over what is now a
flower shop (&amp;#8220;Little Shoppe of Flowers&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;hilarious), he lived with his
parents and wrote &amp;#8220;The Town and the City&amp;#8221;. I believe it was also the
apartment where his father died of stomach cancer, exacerbated by his
drinking. On a busy morning, I rode through traffic on Crossbay
Boulevard to visit the site. A man washed his ambulance on the street
outside. He looked at me like I was crazy for taking a picture of the
building and the small plaque next to the&amp;nbsp;door:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1436/1207598367_f626817141.jpg?v=0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, let me &lt;a href="http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/he-was-a-very-lonely-man/"&gt;join&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18655982&amp;amp;BRD=2731&amp;amp;PAG=461&amp;amp;dept_id=576260&amp;amp;rfi=6"&gt;the chorus&lt;/a&gt; of writers who have come &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/31/joyce-johnson-jack-k.html"&gt;to
praise Kerouac&lt;/a&gt; and to bury him. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s time I picked up &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_of_Duluoz"&gt;Vanity
of Duluoz&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Cassidy"&gt;Maggie Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; one more time. It&amp;#8217;s funny, the

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s one good reason why &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Americans&amp;#8221; need more &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2007/08/22/maps-maps-maps/"&gt;good maps&lt;/a&gt; in

has for budding&amp;nbsp;pornographers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2007/08/22/the-truth-in-numbers/"&gt;I promised earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I have a few resources to share on mapping,
particularly of the Google Maps variety. I had actually been planning on
posting this for the last few days, when I noticed &lt;a href="http://analyticjournalism.blogharbor.com/blog/_archives/2007/8/15/3160819.html"&gt;this mention the
Analytic Journalism blog&lt;/a&gt; of Google&amp;#8217;s new feature that allows users to
embed a personal Google Map into a Web blog using just a tiny snippet of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;. This is a feature that&amp;#8217;s long overdue, and should make all of the
hub-bub over &lt;a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/tag/mapping"&gt;map mash-ups&lt;/a&gt; all the more accessible for the average&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost wish they had offered such a feature last year when I made &lt;a href="http://northjersey.com/static/maps/paterson_map_101506.html"&gt;my
first Google Map&lt;/a&gt;. I was writing an investigative project about the
city of Paterson selling off its property tax liens against vacant lots
to a third-party investor. I decided to take the database I had already
built, and with a little help from Excel, I was able to add the lines of
code that let me dump it into a map using the &lt;a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/"&gt;Google Maps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Without ever having worked with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; in my life&amp;#8212;just a little bit of
rudimentary &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8212;I was able to learn the code and whip up the map in
the span of a couple days. Most of that time was spent on the hardest
part: driving around town with a laptop on my passenger&amp;#8217;s seat and a
photographer in the back taking pictures of each of the 160+ properties
on the map. I thought it came out&amp;nbsp;great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a Google Map to your story (or a Yahoo Map for that matter) is
considerably easier than working with ArcGIS to produce the static maps
you often see in the paper. And its a great Web feature that readers
seem to dig. If you want to learn how to start tinkering with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;,
here&amp;#8217;s a few good starter&amp;nbsp;pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.econym.demon.co.uk/googlemaps/"&gt;Google Maps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://mapki.com/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Mapki: a Google Maps&amp;nbsp;wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/"&gt;Google Maps Mania&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.wotton.org/map/batchgeo.html"&gt;Google Maps geocoder&lt;/a&gt; (which you need to determine the
    longitude and latitude points for the addresses you want to plot on
    a&amp;nbsp;map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://mapmaker.donkeymagic.co.uk/"&gt;Donkey Magic mapmaker&lt;/a&gt; will help you create your map using
    next to no code. It writes the backend source code and you just cut
    and&amp;nbsp;paste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, here&amp;#8217;s a few other of my favorite recent mapping&amp;nbsp;toys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/"&gt;Gmap Pedometer&lt;/a&gt; helps you find routes (and distances between
    destinations) as the crow walks, block by block. This is great for
    living in New York City. I use it to plot out [my weekly bike
    rides][] across the Outer&amp;nbsp;Boroughs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.batchgeocode.com/"&gt;BatchGeocode.com&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource that I seem to use
    again and again for mapping projects large and small. If you have a
    lot of points (more than a few hundred), it can take some time, but
    it&amp;#8217;s free and it&amp;#8217;s easy, like all good maps (and graphics in
    general) should&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2007 18:10:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-08-22:blog/2007/08/maps-maps-maps.html</guid></item><item><title>The truth in numbers</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/08/the-truth-in-numbers.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As the newspaper industry struggles to ensure its relevance in the
changing media landscape, there are a few pioneers out there who have
the right idea. One of them, &lt;a href="http://www.holovaty.com"&gt;Adrian Holovaty&lt;/a&gt;, created the innovative
&lt;a href="http://chicagocrime.org/"&gt;ChicagoCrime.org&lt;/a&gt; by databasing freely-available crime reports from
the Web and mashing them up with Google Maps (more to come on mapping&amp;nbsp;later&amp;#8230;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now another innovator, the St. Pete Times&amp;#8217; &lt;a href="http://www.mattwaite.com/2007/08/22/announcing-politifact/"&gt;Matt Waite&lt;/a&gt; has done
something similar to measure the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness"&gt;truthiness&lt;/a&gt; of next year&amp;#8217;s crop of
presidential hopefuls. &lt;a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/"&gt;Politifact&lt;/a&gt; is a Web site built on a growing
database of political rhetoric, checked out with old-fashioned
reporting. It&amp;#8217;s not only interesting and entertaining to see which
candidates&amp;#8217; &lt;a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/rulings/pants-fire/"&gt;pants are on fire&lt;/a&gt;, but it proves that today&amp;#8217;s
journalists will have a great future as newspapers evolve out of their
current doldrums&amp;#8212;if those intrepid aces can think about what readers&amp;#8217;
want and what they can actually use. I think Matt sums it up&amp;nbsp;nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;All the talk and all the focus lately in web journalism circles is on
local, local, local and to some degree they’re right. But there’s also
something to be said for just putting a good idea on the web that
people might find&amp;nbsp;useful.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

the limitations the medium could impose on&amp;nbsp;journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNet News.com posted a story looking at how some of &lt;a href="http://news.com.com/Newspaper+headlines+lost+in+Web+translation/2100-1025_3-6155618.html" title="Google to user: Drop Dead"&gt;history&amp;#8217;s best
headlines&lt;/a&gt; might not hack it in the digital age. Here&amp;#8217;s what they
write about one of my&amp;nbsp;favorites&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ford to city: Drop dead&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; New York Daily News reporting

impatiently demanding that I have all my ducks in a row while I continue
to get the new site up and running. I&amp;#8217;d say I&amp;#8217;m about 80 percent of the
way there. I have a few design features I need to tweak (anybody notice
that the word &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt; disappears when you roll over it on the navigation
bar? Any suggestions?), and some more background content to add before
I&amp;#8217;m completely happy with this site going forward. Once the backend is
set, my hope is to post on here about once or twice a&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, right now you can check out the &lt;a href="/best-practices/"&gt;Best Practices&lt;/a&gt; section.
Today, I added about a dozen short write-ups I&amp;#8217;ve collected over the
years. That part of the site is intended as a repository of tips,
techniques and guidelines for tasks many reporters are faced with. From
how to cover a municipal beat, to how to cover a weather story, to some
basic statistical analysis. A few of the beginner Best Practices are up
right now. Over the next few weeks, I&amp;#8217;ll put up the rest of my archives.&amp;nbsp;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2007 17:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-08-21:blog/2007/08/a-little-reading-while-i-clear-my-throat.html</guid></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/08/archives.html</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2007 14:22:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-08-20:blog/2007/08/archives.html</guid></item><item><title>Growing pains</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/08/growing-pains.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Please bear with me over the next few days.

Minneapolis, journalists around the country embraced the power of
computer-assisted reporting to enhance their reporting. One such
reporter compiled a cool list of &lt;a href="http://journalistopia.com/2007/08/03/roundup-of-minneapolis-bridge-collapse-coverage-graphics/"&gt;many of the great stories they
produced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the praise for this response is owed to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRE&lt;/span&gt; and its &lt;a href="http://www.ire.org/datalibrary/"&gt;database
library&lt;/a&gt;. Many in the industry knew immediately that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRE&lt;/span&gt; keeps a copy
of the &lt;a href="http://www.ire.org/datalibrary/databases/viewdatabase.php?dbaseindex=16"&gt;national bridge inspection inventory database&lt;/a&gt; created by the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Department of Transportation. &lt;a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003621184"&gt;Hundreds flooded &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRE&lt;/span&gt; with requests
for the database&lt;/a&gt;. I was one of them. With little time, my colleagues
and I managed to pull together a story telling readers about the
&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTc3Mjcx"&gt;troubled bridges in our area&lt;/a&gt;. My only regret was that we did not
have the time to throw our own local &amp;#8220;structurally deficient&amp;#8221; bridges
into a map for our&amp;nbsp;readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s help, though, we likely would not have had a story at all.
If you&amp;#8217;re not already familiar with their tipsheets and databases and
help, then acquaint yourself quickly. So the next time news of public
safety breaks, you&amp;#8217;ll be&amp;nbsp;ready.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Aug 2007 01:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-08-09:blog/2007/08/the-data-behind-a-disaster.html</guid></item><item><title>Idealistic muckraker</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/08/idealistic-muckraker.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;From my old Web site&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;bio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when I wonder what I&amp;#8217;ve gotten into by becoming a&amp;nbsp;journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I spent 11 hours a day working as a laborer &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/temporarylife"&gt;for a story&lt;/a&gt; only to
go to my temporary home with its shabby little bed in a rooming house, I
pondered whether my reporting would make a&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another story, I trudged bootless through knee-deep flood waters in a
ramshackle and neglected neighborhood along the Passaic River in
Paterson, New Jersey. I thought that people might not be able to
comprehend the suffering of the poor that natural disasters could only&amp;nbsp;compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when, on assignment, I choked on pepper spray as I stood among
protesters being arrested, taking notes at a presidential inauguration,
I worried that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to breathe&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But each of these times, and every day before and since, I reminded
myself that if I do not write these stories, no one else will. My job is
to shine a light on the lives of working Americans. Without these
stories, our understanding of modern life is not only incomplete, it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quest to tell these stories began for me at 18, when I moved from my
hometown of Baltimore to the Midwest. I began to dive into the lives of
the working-class and the forgotten Americans that I would &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/temporarylife"&gt;later
chronicle in my work&lt;/a&gt;. Even while I studied at, and
eventually was graduated from, the world&amp;#8217;s first journalism school at
the &lt;a href="http://www.journalism.missouri.edu"&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, I longed to write their&amp;nbsp;stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have worked for several newspapers and a wire service. But
I also worked in a hodgepodge of fields that have reminded me of the
greater world, a world outside the halls of government and police
stations where we as journalists often find ourselves stuck. I have been
a welder, a construction laborer, a deli worker, a short-order cook, a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ&lt;/span&gt;, a dishwasher, a record store clerk, a grocery store bagger and a&amp;nbsp;closed-captioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I moved to New York City where I completed my Master&amp;#8217;s
degree at the &lt;a href="http://www.jrn.columbia.edu"&gt;Graduate School of Journalism&lt;/a&gt; at Columbia&amp;nbsp;University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I live in Brooklyn with my wife, her very fat cat and our very
old dog. I am the research reporter&amp;#8212;responsible for computer-assisted
reporting and freedom of information requests&amp;#8212;for the daily &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/"&gt;Herald
News&lt;/a&gt;, about 20 miles away in New Jersey. My job allows me to pursue
the kind of journalism I&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to do. I get to write
stories&amp;#8212;about corruption, about poverty, about working, about floods
and protests&amp;#8212;that people need to read. I get to write stories that show
our readers a world they never knew existed or, worse yet, never&amp;nbsp;understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what little free time I have, I am also researching a book that I
began while a student in Samuel Freedman&amp;#8217;s renowned &lt;a href="http://www.samuelfreedman.com/seminar.html"&gt;book-writing
seminar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very glad you stumbled upon this Web site. I hope you&amp;#8217;re looking for
the kind of stories that I like to write, stories about people who never
get recognized. Now you&amp;#8217;ll know to watch for my byline. You&amp;#8217;ll be
reading a lot more of my&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Aug 2007 01:25:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.tommeagher.com,2007-08-09:blog/2007/08/idealistic-muckraker.html</guid></item><item><title>Brooklyn reporter eaten by vampires!</title><link>www.tommeagher.com/blog/2007/08/brooklyn-reporter-eaten-by-vampires.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I can think of no better way to launch this new experiment in blogging
than to sadly note the passing of an icon of American journalism. As it
was &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/business/media/30weekly.html"&gt;reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, the venerable &lt;a href="http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/" title="Weekly World News"&gt;Weekly World News&lt;/a&gt;
will soon go dark. This fine purveyor of insane fictional columnists and
alien abductions has entertained shoppers at grocery stores nationwide
for decades. The progenitor of &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com"&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/most_recent/index.jhtml"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, it developed a devoted cult following. It died at&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, I&amp;#8217;ll briefly introduce this site. I hope it will serve as
a platform for me to share some of my experiences and work as a
newspaper journalist in &lt;a href="http://www.nicar.org/"&gt;computer-assisted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ire.org/"&gt;investigative
reporting&lt;/a&gt;. I also plan to share techniques and Web resources that I
find useful in my daily reporting. It will pay for you to keep an eye on
the &amp;#8220;Cool Resources&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/17713610159695614602/label/reporting-blog"&gt;Reporting &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; feeds on the right&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my spare moments, I hope to be able to comment on one of my other
