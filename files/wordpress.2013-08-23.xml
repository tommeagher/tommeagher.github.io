<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm Tom Meagher, the Data Editor for <a href="http://www.nj.com" target="_blank">The Star-Ledger</a>, New Jersey's largest newspaper.

As my title suggests, I specialize inÂ <strong><a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction_0.html" target="_new">data journalism</a></strong>. When I started doing this work, it was called computer-assisted reporting or CAR, which was even more vague and confusing to all but the most devout practitioners.

With my team at the Ledger, I pull kernels of stories out of arcane databases and bring them to life through meticulous analysis, document-based investigation and old school, shoe leather reporting.

Doing this involves a considerable amount of time creating graphics and interactives to make complex topics accessible to readers. More and more, I find myself falling into the arms of programming, developing my skills in Python to scrape data from websites when agencies won't share. <strong>To say I'm comfortable with a spreadsheet and a command line is an understatement</strong>.

What really gets me jazzed is when I can use these techniques to expose the ineptitude and outright corruption of officials who are supposed to work in the public interest. The role of the journalist as a watchdog on the powerful is what made me fall in love with this craft in the first place.

TomMeagher.com is my personal website. The standard disavowals and disclaimers apply. Obviously, any views I express here about the state of journalism or the database magick I cast in its name are mine alone and do not represent any of my employers, past or present--from the Pizza Hut where I washed dishes in high school to Advance Publications, the Star-Ledger's parent.

You may also care to know that I'm a soccer fanatic, a homebrewer, a vinyl record collector and reggae deejay.

To contact me, hit me up on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ultracasual" target="_new">@ultracasual</a> or send an email: <em><strong>hello(at)thedomainofthiswebsite.com</strong></em> (just one dotcom at the end, not two)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I can think of no better way to launch this new experiment in blogging than to sadly note the passing of an icon of American journalism. As it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/business/media/30weekly.html" target="_blank">reported earlier this week</a>, the venerable <a href="http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/" title="Weekly World News" target="_blank">Weekly World News</a> will soon go dark. This fine purveyor of insane fictional columnists and alien abductions has entertained shoppers at grocery stores nationwide for decades. The progenitor of <a href="http://www.theonion.com" target="_blank">The Onion</a>, <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/most_recent/index.jhtml" target="_blank">The Colbert Report</a> and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com" target="_blank">Fox News</a>, it developed a devoted cult following. It died at 28.

On that note, I'll briefly introduce this site. I hope it will serve as a platform for me to share some of my experiences and work as a newspaper journalist in <a href="http://www.nicar.org/" target="_new">computer-assisted</a> and <a href="http://www.ire.org/" target="_new">investigative reporting</a>. I also plan to share techniques and Web resources that I find useful in my daily reporting. It will pay for you to keep an eye on the "Cool Resources" and "<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/17713610159695614602/label/reporting-blog" target="_blank">Reporting &amp; CAR</a>" feeds on the right column.

In my spare moments, I hope to be able to comment on one of my other passions: <a href="http://www.mlsnet.com/" title="Major League Soccer" target="_blank">soccer</a>. Let's see where this all leads us. Thanks for tuning in.

Cheers.]]></content:encoded>

<span style="font-size: large">WORK EXPERIENCE</span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
<strong>Data Editor </strong>December 2010-present
<em><a href="http://www.nj.com/" target="_blank">The Star-Ledger</a></em><a href="http://www.nj.com/" target="_blank"></a>, Newark, N.J.
235,000 daily circulation
Oversee a team of reporters and researchers charged with developing data-driven enterprise stories using computer-assisted reporting techniques. Focused on presenting data online for readers and building accessible and engaging visualizations with open source tools.</span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
<strong>News editor </strong>February 2009-December 2010
<em><a href="http://www.nj.com/" target="_blank">New Jersey Local News Service</a></em><a href="http://www.nj.com/" target="_blank"></a>, Somerville, N.J.
235,000 daily circulation
Directed a team of seven reporters covering municipal news across two counties for The Star-Ledger. My reporters wrote dozens of front page pieces and broke stories about $30 million wasted on a sewage plant and the questionable practices of a multimillion-dollar, for-profit, second-hand clothing chain. With this Advance Publications company at its inception, I helped interview dozens of candidates for 17 reporter openings.</span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
<strong>City editor </strong>December 2007-February 2009
<em><a href="http://www.myheraldnews.com" target="_new">Herald News</a></em>, West Paterson, N.J.
30,000 daily circulation
Led 13 reporters and three editors to cover three cities and their surrounding suburbs for this 30,000-circulation daily. During my tenure, the paper was honored as the best small daily in the state. Led workshops on investigative techniques. Coached reporters to produce stories about imprisoned firefighters forging documents for work-release programs, sanitation workers destroying a city truck in a hit-and-run accident and contractors who duped homeowners into unneeded mortgages.</span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
<strong>Computer-assisted reporter</strong> June 2006 - December 2007
<em><a href="http://www.myheraldnews.com" target="_new">Herald News</a></em></span>
<ul><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
	<li>Responsible for the newspaper's databases, mapping and investigations. One of my stories exposed a quiet deal between the mayor and a developer that cost the nearly-bankrupt city of Paterson $9 million. Another piece examined the most dangerous intersections for pedestrians in the county.</li>
	<li>Led newsroom training courses in CAR, investigative techniques and freedom of information laws.</li>
	<li>Conceived, designed and maintained the newspaperâs intranet site, âPage Oneâ, a repository for training, beat memos and best practices.</li>
</span></ul>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> <strong>Municipal reporter</strong> July 2004 - May 2006
<em><a href="http://www.myheraldnews.com" target="_new">Herald News</a></em>
Covering the troubled city of Paterson, I consistently broke stories of import to our readers, from city lawyers sexually harassing secretaries at public meetings to parents worried about escalating gun violence. My stories here won state and regional awards.</span>

<strong>Sports stringer</strong> March 2002 - August 2002
<a href="http://www.ap.org/" target="_new">Associated Press</a> Kansas City, Mo.
As a stringer for the wire service, I reported on Kansas Cityâs <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/" target="_blank">Major League Soccer</a> team, the Wizards. Filing fast match reports and longer post-game analyses forced me to become quick, concise and accurate. Unfortunately, I had to leave this job when I moved from the Midwest to New York City.</span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
<strong>Reporter</strong> January 2000 - December 2000
<em><a href="http://www.ljworld.com" target="_new">Lawrence Journal-World</a></em>, Lawrence, Kan.
20,000 daily circulation
Covered the police and fire departments as a night cops reporter at this 20,000-circulation daily that pioneered the multimedia convergence newsroom.</span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
<strong>Intern</strong> August 1999 - December 1999
<em><a href="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/" target="_new">Spokane Spokesman-Review</a>, <a href="http://www.vaildaily.com/apps/pbcs.dll/frontpage" target="_new">Vail Daily</a>, <a href="http://www.leadvillechronicle.com/home.php" target="_new">Leadville Chronicle</a></em> Washington, DC
As an intern, I reported on all three branches of the federal government, relating events in the Capitol to readers in Washington state and Colorado.</span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
<strong>Police reporter and copy editor</strong> January 1998 - May 1999
<em><a href="http://www.columbiamissourian.com/" target="_new">Columbia Missourian</a></em> Columbia, Mo.
While in college, I worked as a police and general assignment reporter and copy editor at this 5,500-circulation, commercial community daily operated by the University of Missouriâs School of Journalism. </span>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[From my old Web site's bio:

There are times when I wonder what I've gotten into by becoming a journalist.

When I spent 11 hours a day working as a laborer <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/temporarylife" target="_new">for a story</a> only to go to my temporary home with its shabby little bed in a rooming house, I pondered whether my reporting would make a difference.

On another story, I trudged bootless through knee-deep flood waters in a ramshackle and neglected neighborhood along the Passaic River in Paterson, New Jersey. I thought that people might not be able to comprehend the suffering of the poor that natural disasters could only compound.

And when, on assignment, I choked on pepper spray as I stood among protesters being arrested, taking notes at a presidential inauguration, I worried that I wouldn't be able to breathe again.

But each of these times, and every day before and since, I reminded myself that if I do not write these stories, no one else will. My job is to shine a light on the lives of working Americans. Without these stories, our understanding of modern life is not only incomplete, it's inaccurate.

The quest to tell these stories began for me at 18, when I moved from my hometown of Baltimore to the Midwest. I began to dive into the lives of the working-class and the forgotten Americans that I would <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/temporarylife" target="_new">later chronicle in my work</a>. Even while I studied at, and eventually was graduated from, the world's first journalism school at the <a href="http://www.journalism.missouri.edu" target="_new">University of Missouri</a>, I longed to write their stories.

Since then, I have worked for several newspapers and a wire service. But I also worked in a hodgepodge of fields that have reminded me of the greater world, a world outside the halls of government and police stations where we as journalists often find ourselves stuck. I have been a welder, a construction laborer, a deli worker, a short-order cook, a DJ, a dishwasher, a record store clerk, a grocery store bagger and a closed-captioner.

Along the way, I moved to New York City where I completed my Master's degree at the <a href="http://www.jrn.columbia.edu" target="_new">Graduate School of Journalism</a> at Columbia University.

Today, I live in Brooklyn with my wife, her very fat cat and our very old dog. I am the research reporter--responsible for computer-assisted reporting and freedom of information requests--for the daily <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/" target="_new">Herald News</a>, about 20 miles away in New Jersey. My job allows me to pursue the kind of journalism I've always wanted to do. I get to write stories--about corruption, about poverty, about working, about floods and protests--that people need to read. I get to write stories that show our readers a world they never knew existed or, worse yet, never understood.

In what little free time I have, I am also researching a book that I began while a student in Samuel Freedman's renowned <a href="http://www.samuelfreedman.com/seminar.html" target="_new">book-writing seminar</a>.

I'm very glad you stumbled upon this Web site. I hope you're looking for the kind of stories that I like to write, stories about people who never get recognized. Now you'll know to watch for my byline. You'll be reading a lot more of my work.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Amidst the shock and tragedy of last week's bridge collapse in Minneapolis, journalists around the country embraced the power of computer-assisted reporting to enhance their reporting. One such reporter compiled a cool list of <a href="http://journalistopia.com/2007/08/03/roundup-of-minneapolis-bridge-collapse-coverage-graphics/" target="_new">many of the great stories they produced</a>.

Some of the praise for this response is owed to IRE and its <a href="http://www.ire.org/datalibrary/" target="_new">database library</a>. Many in the industry knew immediately that IRE keeps a copy of the <a href="http://www.ire.org/datalibrary/databases/viewdatabase.php?dbaseindex=16" target="_new">national bridge inspection inventory database</a> created by the U.S. Department of Transportation. <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003621184" target="_blank">Hundreds flooded IRE with requests for the database</a>. I was one of them. With little time, my colleagues and I managed to pull together a story telling readers about the <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTc3Mjcx" target="_new">troubled bridges in our area</a>. My only regret was that we did not have the time to throw our own local "structurally deficient" bridges into a map for our readers.

Without IRE's help, though, we likely would not have had a story at all. If you're not already familiar with their tipsheets and databases and help, then acquaint yourself quickly. So the next time news of public safety breaks, you'll be ready.]]></content:encoded>

<title>The Copy Desk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>How to Keep the Copy Desk Off Your Back</strong>
Good editing begins with you, the writer. While it's a copy editor's job to catch mistakes, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's your job not to make them in the first place</span>. Never leave anything unchecked in your story or expect someone else will correct the mistake. Remember, that's your job. Here's a few helpful hints:

Follow the four "C's." Is your story:
<strong>Clear</strong>?
Who's talking? What's it about? Are the transitions smooth? Does the lead adequately introduce the story? Will this be apparent to everyone reading the story? Try to anticipate questions a reader may have. And don't let creativity get in the way of clarity.
<strong>Concise</strong>?
Don't use four words when one will suffice. Don't dance around what's important; get to the point. One person's delayed lead is another's buried lead.
<strong>Correct</strong>?
Did you double and triple check the key facts of the story?
<strong>Complete</strong>?
Are all the facts presented substantiated? Are all sides of the story represented? If not, do you explain why?

Also:
1. Follow styles, both in-house and from the Associated Press. Ninety percent of our styles are found in the AP stylebook and Webster's New World Collegiate Dictionary. The company maintains an online stylebook as well.
2. KEEP IT SIMPLE. A basic writing premise is one thought per sentence. If you find yourself cramming too much into one sentence, such as offsetting one or more clauses that aren't necessarily related, it might be time to rewrite the sentence.
3. CQ items when necessary. This goes for unusual names (Jesica instead of Jessica), titles and really anything that you'd think would make the reader go, "That has to be wrong," but in fact, it is correct. And, if you put CQ next to something, you're telling the editor that you did indeed look this up and have confirmed it's correct.
4. Avoid editorializing. Be careful what words you use to be descriptive. Subtle judgments and opinions have a way of creeping into stories. If you're using too many adverbs and adjectives, that's a good sign that you're not being as objective as you should. Simple words such as "only" or "just" are good examples of things to avoid.

Most of all remember, no matter what, we're still likely to ask you questions. Consider it part of the job and try to take even the seemingly silly ones in stride.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everybody knows how to run a simple Web search in Google. But for a journalist trying to find information on the Web, the popular search engine offers dozens of more refined applications.<br><br>
<a href="http://sree.net/" target="_new">Sree Sreenivasan</a> of Columbia University offers <a href="http://www.sreetips.com/google.html" target="_new">this great primer</a> on getting more out of your searches.<br><br>

His best tip involves using Google's Advanced Search, which you can find at <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search" target="_new">http://www.google.com/advanced_search</a>. With it, you can search for pages in foreign languages. You can search for documents in certain formats, such as PDFs and DOCs. You can also narrow your search to only a certain domain or a certain date. When you know that your town's Web site has a key piece of information that you need, this is ideal for culling through a site to find the gem.<br>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[From a seminar I taught several years ago, a list of some of the most useful sites I use again and again:

<a href="http://www.ire.org/" target="_new">Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors</a>:  This organization is a lifesaver. If you're not a member, you're missing out. The Web site features several invaluable e-mail listservs on investigative and computer-assisted reporting (with full archives of past conversations), beat guides and resource lists for nearly any beat you can imagine, as well as tipsheets, tutorials and ideas for stories on a massive array of topics. This should be your first stop anytime you're covering a new beat or a new topic.

<a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search" target="_new">Google Advanced:</a> Make your Internet searches more useful by using the advanced features. You can search only certain domains (http://www.state.nj.us/) or for certain file types (Excel spreadsheets or PDFs). Here's a <a href="http://www.google.com/help/refinesearch.html" target="_new">tipsheet</a>.

<a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/" target="_new">American Factfinder</a>:  <a href="census.html">The Census'</a> Web site allows you to do your own digging through its voluminous databases. You will want to use this resource weekly, if not more often. If you don't know how, sign up for this month's research skills session.

<a href="http://www.dataplace.org/" target="_new">Dataplace</a>: Sponsored by Fannie Mae, this site makes it even easier to get basic demographic, housing market and economic data for your towns. It also has some nifty mapping functions that will help you easily visualize your town's demographics.

<a href="http://www.elec.state.nj.us/" target="_new">New Jersey's Election Law Enforcement Commission</a>: Get all the skinny on who is giving money to your elected officials. If you missed February's class on how to mine ELEC for stories, check out the <a href="http://pageone/campfin.html">backgrounder on PageOne</a>.

<a href="http://www.feedmap.net/BlogMap/" target="_new">FeedMap</a>: Find local bloggers quickly.

<a href="http://woodrow.mpls.frb.fed.us/research/data/us/calc/" target="_new">Inflation Calculator</a>: The Federal Reserve helps you easily figure out how much the dollar has changed over time. Great for comparing incomes or home prices over decades.

<a href="http://climate.rutgers.edu/stateclim/NJ" target="_new">State Climatologist</a>: Indispensable local resources for the dreaded weather story (<a href="http://pageone/weather.html">http://pageone/weather.html</a>)

<a href="http://www.trulia.com" target="_new">Trulia</a>: Local real estate search engine that can give you a feel for recent home sales. It also has fantastic mapping functions.

<a href="http://www.guidestar.org" target="_new">Guidestar</a>: The first stop whenever you're writing about a charity. You can get the IRS form 990 for free.
If you don't find a charity there, check the <a href="http://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/charity/chardir.htm" target="_new">state's directory</a>.
If a group isn't listed, it's not a legal charity in New Jersey. [Make sure that you look for all variants on a name. Charities are often listed in the directory using uncommon spelling or punctuation, so be sure to cover your bases.]

<a href="https://accessnet.state.nj.us/home.asp" target="_new">NJ Business Gateway</a>: Anybody doing business in the state needs to register his company at this pay site run by the Department of Revenue.

<a href="https://www6.state.nj.us/DOC_Inmate/inmatefinder?i=I" target="_new">Inmate finder</a>: Wanna know if someone has ever done time in NJ on a felony? They'll be listed here. First stop in backgrounding anyone in a crime story.

<a href="http://www.depthreporting.com" target="_new">Depth Reporting</a>: A fantastic blog chock full of the latest killer Web sites and research resources.

<a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/" target="_new">Acronym finder</a>: This can help cut through jargon and demystify governmentese.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Public notices are an especially rich source for you beat reporters. Since governments must by law advertise what they do, including ordinances, public hearings, property transfers, elections processes, bond sales, budgets, etc., public notices are a kind of list of potential story topics. They are in our newspapers, of course, but you cannot always get to them on the day of publication.

The NJ Press Association has started a web site that lists all public notices for three months or so back, from state to county to local governments and agencies.

The site, which I've had the chance to visit, is <a href="http://www.njpublicnotices.com" target="_new">www.njpublicnotices.com</a>. [Other states can also be found here: <a href="http://www.publicnoticeads.com/" target="_new">www.publicnoticeads.com</a>]

It has a search tool to target particular notices, such as "sheriff's sale" or "chancery" or "Paterson" or "Board of Education."

A good way to use the NJPA service: visit the list every week before doing your weekbooks. Do a manual search to show a list of notices relevant to your beat. Then see if there's something you  missed recently or should write on in the coming week.

<h2>Covering Islam</h2>
From the Herald News archives:
<strong>Before visiting a mosque</strong>, take note of the following:
<ul>
	<li>women should wear long sleeves and long pants or a long skirt; loose-fitting clothing only, preferably not in bright colors</li>
	<li>women should put a scarf over their hair, one that is not see-through</li>
	<li>women should not wear perfume or anything else that would distract from the solemnity of the setting</li>
	<li>neither men nor women should wear shorts</li>
	<li>expect to take off your shoes before you enter the prayer room</li>
	<li>expect women and men to pray separately</li>
	<li>expect that a person of the opposite sex will not shake your hand; men and women who are not related or married to each other often do not touch.(Some people may make exceptions, because they don't want to offend non-Muslims, but very religious people, like the spiritual leaders known as imams, will decline to shake hands)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Side note on names</strong>:
When asking Arab-Americans or Arab immigrants for the spelling of their names, be very careful. For example, they may spell a name "Elfalali" for you, but you should ask if there is a space between the El and the Falali, if the F is capitalized, and if there is a hyphen between El and Falali. Also, there are numerous ways to spell the common name, Muhammad (including Mohamed, Mohammed, Mohammad, etc). Ask and ask again.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[To "background" someone is to take a thorough look at their work, financial and criminal histories to ensure that the public has all the appropriate information about an individual that they need.

Here are some of the people on whom reporter should do a background check:
<ul>1.	All candidates for local, county and state elected office;
2.	Anyone we profile in a story;
3.	Anyone assuming a leading role in a public agency, nonprofit or nongovernmental organization;
4.	Any educator or business leader in the news;
5.	Anyone who is the focus of a crime-related breaking news story;
6.	Anyone else who the reporter thinks he or she needs to background.</ul>
The first thing you should do is check our library to see what, if anything, we have written about this person before.

The process:
NOTE: all of the information that is found in common resources such as the Internet <strong><u>MUST</u></strong> be verified before using in the newspaper. Internet research is meant to be a tool to guide reporting, not as a definitive source.

1. GENERIC BACKGROUND CHECK (This should be done first and with Nos. 1-6)

Verify address, property ownership - if any -- age, family, marital status, employment record, criminal history - if any - and whether the individual was involved in any criminal or civil lawsuits. Run the person's name through our electronic archives.

Web sites you can use include (you don't need to use all of them, just whatever ones are the most helpful in collecting information):

-<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_new">Google.com</a> (just run their name and see what comes up)

-<a href="http://www.Nexis.com" target="_new">Nexis.com</a> (will give you address, age, family, criminal background, lawsuits)

-<a href="http://pacer.psc/uscourts.gov" target="_new">PACER</a> (federal courts for bankruptcy, civil or criminal suits)

-<a href="http://www.pretrieve.com/" target="_new">Pretrieve.com</a>  (generic records search)

-<a href="http://www.searchsystems.net" target="_new">Searchsystems.net</a> (generic records search)

-<a href="http://www.argali.com/" target="_new">Argali</a> (phone numbers, generic records search)

-<a href="http://www.reversephonedirectory.com/" target="_new">Reversephonedirectory.com</a> (phone numbers, addresses)

-<a href="http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/" target="_new">ZoomInfo.com</a> (generic records search)

-<a href="http://www.zabasearch.com/" target="_new">ZabaSearch.com</a> (people search)

-<a href="https://www6.state.nj.us/DOC_Inmate/inmatefinder?i=I" target="_new">NJ Inmate finder</a> (NJDOC inmate locator)

-<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/cac/states.htm" target="_new">FBI sex offenders registries</a> (FBI link to states' sex offender registry)

-<a href="http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/LocateInmate.jsp" target="_new">Federal inmate locator</a> (federal inmate locator)

-<a href="http://www.njactb.org" target="_new">NJACTB.org</a> (NJ Association of County Tax Boards - will have property ownership and tax data)

2. POLITICANS, ELECTED OFFICIALS (Nos. 1-4)

-<a href="http://www.elec.state.nj.us/" target="_new">ELEC</a> (NJELEC for what the subject gave or received in campaign donations)

-<a href="http://www.nexis.com" target="_new">Nexis.com</a> (state voter registration information - does the candidate vote regularly?)

-<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/index.asp" target="_new">OpenSecrets.org</a> (search for donations to federal politicians - must have name of donor)

-<a href="http://www.fec.gov/disclosure.shtml" target="_new">FEC.gov</a> (FEC campaign and data reports)

-obtain local annual financial disclosure statement (on file with municipal clerk; most local officials, elected or otherwise, must file annually)

-contact the subject's municipal tax collector to make sure they've paid their property taxes.

3. BUSINESS, NONPROFITS INQUIRIES

-<a href="http://www.guidestar.org" target="_new">Guidestar.org</a> (IRS 990s - annual federal income report charities must file)

-<a href="http://www.state.nj.us/lps/ca/charfrm.htm" target="_new">Directory of NJ registered charities</a>

-<a href="http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm" target="_new">EDGAR</a> (all financial documents related to publicly-traded companies are filed here. This will only be helpful for execs of the handful of big public companies in our readership area)

-<a href="https://accessnet.state.nj.us/home.asp" target="_new">NJ Business Gateway</a> (NJ's business gateway site. Run the subject's name to see what, if any, business interests he or she owns.)

-<a href="http://www.nexis.com" target="_new">Nexis.com</a>(UCC debt shows up here. UCC debt refers to loans a business owner might have made to secure equipment to run the business. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll also get an Experian credit profile of the owner's company.)

-<a href="http://www.state.nj.us/cgi-bin/consumeraffairs/search/searchentry.pl" target="_new">Consumer Affairs</a> (NJ Div. of Consumer Affairs - check here if the subject claims to be licensed in some area other than as a teacher)

-<a href="http://www.state.nj.us/njded/educators/license/" target="_new">Educators licensing</a> (NJDOE department of licensure and credentials - call these folks to see if your teacher is really a teacher)

4. MILITARY (did they really serve? Did they really get that medal?)

-<a href="http://www.nara.gov/regional/stlouis.html" target="_new">NARA.gov</a> (National Archives and Records Administration: military records for those deceased or discharged. Note: You'll have to fill out a form and wait.)

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[This policy is a good place to start for reporters new to daily journalism. This holds especially true for municipal and government reporters:

1) Evening before: talk to assignment editor live or by phone to make sure we're on the same page and make game plan about next day's assignment and schedule. File photo requests.
2) Arrive 10 a.m. Check Voicemails. Open e-mail. Call for evening meeting agendas. Read newspaper.
3) If scheduled in weekbook, go to beat first. Or spend first 30 minutes calling beat sources to develop source list and find stories. But if you go to beat first, call in before 11:15 to check in with editor.
4) By 11 a.m., check daily budget. Make sure budget line and weekbook match. If skeleton budget line, send full budget line. Make sure of deadline on daily budget.
5) Plan time to complete and file dailies by deadline. If your are doing overnight story, spend 5-10 minutes rereading notes. Underline lede subject, best quotes, issues you will report. Make calls to fill holes or check facts. Spend 10 minutes prewriting/outlining.Write top. Then take a short break.
6) If story is not an overnight, plan, make round of calls, spend 5 to 10 minutes in story conference with editor.
7) Complete live assignment reporting. Either call from field to check in with assignment editor or talk to assignment editor as soon as you get back
8 ) On Dailies, depending on whether live event, write top before 2:30 meeting. Five minute story conference with editor who reads top.
9) Overnight deadlines 2 p.m. Daily deadline 4 p.m.
10) Edit and Rewrite time.
11) After deadline,  go over agenda for night meetings with editor for story selection.
12) After deadline, update weekbook. 10 minutes. Enter new stories and add story ideas/tips. Don't keep lower list
13) Take dinner break/rest before night meetings.
14) Arrive early for meetings. 10-15 minute Schmooze.

additionally:
A) write list of all officials on boards/councils that you cover in your towns. Check the ones you know now, and find a way to meet the others. Work on your beat map.

<title>Fair Comment</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Rule of Fair Comment may be defined simply as seeking comment from differing sides in a news story. It applies to all stories, but especially to stories that involve conflict, dispute, allegations, disagreement and argument. It is founded in the same basic principle underlying American jurisprudence: that individuals have a right to defend themselves in public against charges made against them. While jurisprudence begins with the assumption of innocence, journalism uses fair comment as one of several basic methods of verifying the accuracy of information and providing as truthful and thorough an account as possible.

The U.S. Constitution does not require press fairness under the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Nevertheless, common law has long upheld an individual's right not to be defamed, slandered or libeled by the publication of false or inaccurate information. Thus the Rule of Fair Comment has a positive and negative aspect. In a positive sense, it encourages verification of accuracy of information by asking firsthand sources to state their version of the facts. In the negative sense, it curbs the publication of falsehoods by the threat of libel suits.

In a general sense, the Rule of Fair Comment increases the credibility of the press. The power of a free press is directly related to credibility. As journalists, we are often required to write about topics we have little expertise in. People believe what they read in the newspaper not because they trust our superior knowledge, experience or ability to recognize truth over falsehood, but because we warrant our stories with a repeatable, transparent method. That method includes questioning firsthand sources and not printing hearsay, defined as someone repeating what someone else said.

Finally, fair comment doesn't have much to do with balance, objectivity or neutrality. We are not gods. We are humans who struggle against our own biases to discern truth because we believe deeply the truth sets all of us free. Fair comment is integral to that struggle.

- <em>Cristian Salazar and Jonathan Maslow</em>, Herald News, April, 2006

<hr /><strong>The Disclaimer Policy</strong>
Reporting balance is our <em>sina qua non</em>. That means getting both sides of the story. We sometimes cannot reach news sources before deadline. But we must always try. It's part of our contract with readers to make a good-faith effort to reach sources and to let readers know we have done so. Whenever we have tried to reach a news source and failed before deadline, it's a good practice to include a concise sentence in the story to that effect.
It need not be complicated:
<blockquote><em>The mayor did not return a phone call Tuesday.
The company could not be reached for comment.
Di Carlo did not return repeated phone calls.
Attorney General's Office spokesman Try Speaker said there would be no comment.</em></blockquote>
Placement of such a disclaimer within a story is up to the reporter, but it's better to put it high, just after a sentence that would normally elicit fair comment.
The omission of this type of disclaimer sentence leads the reader to believe we did not try-- and the credibility of the article and the newspaper suffers.

<title>B-matter</title>
<link>http://blog.tommeagher.com/best-practices/b-matter/</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2007 20:39:20 +0000</pubDate>
<dc:creator><![CDATA[Tom]]></dc:creator>

<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.tommeagher.com/best-practices/b-matter/</guid>
<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>B-matter</strong>: The essential background information for a night story that can be written ahead of time to save precious minutes on deadline.

1. Identify stories that will require filing B-matter and live top as early as possible, but before 2:30 pm in all cases.

2. A front end conversation between reporter and editor sets the following parameters: length and deadline of B-matter; what it should contain; what live top should contain; drop deadline for live top; how live top will be filed: by phone, by email, by remote laptop. Who can reporter contact beforehand to line up live quotes for story? The front end conversation is a must if things are to go smoothely at deadline.

3. Consistency of editor. Ideally, one editor should edit both B-matter and live top. When that's not possible, the first editor should finish editing B-matter before reporter leaves for assignment and inform second editor precisely what needs to be done, when. That information should be reflected in the budget line.

4. Don't overwrite B-matter. Write a realistic length, leaving adequate space for live reporting. For instance, public hearing stories obviously depend on capturing the comments of the public: keep B-matter to a bare minimum. On the other hand, stories that depend on votes (ordinances, contracts, etc.) should be esentially whole with B-matter, putting alternative ledes in notes mode. In almost all cases B-matter is the back story, the context, the background. It answers the question how we got to this point? But sometimes B-matter can also include pre-written reaction to something you know is going to happen.

5. In all cases, B-matter must be read and edited before reporter leaves for assignment.

6. Discuss backout schedule with your editor: The top has to be turned in by, say, 9 p.m. That means the reporter has to start writing at, say, 8:15 p.m. That means the reporter can only attend the first, say, 45 minutes of the meeting or event. That means the reporter should arrive 15 minutes early and get some live quotes from the participants or audience.

7. Reporters must stick to the gameplan: if they are supposed to file a top at, say, 9 p.m., they cannot call at 9:15 and ask for another 10 minutes. When such things happen, editors are well within their rights to kill the story. Indeed, where there's some doubt about getting the story on time, editors are smart to prepare a substitute story from the wire or elsewhere.

8. Reporters must not, under any circumstances, change B-matter that has already been edited without first notfiying the editor and getting approval. If changes are required, tell editor!!!

9. Don't overwrite top. Editors don't have time on deadline to cut articles, and it's not necessary to do so, if the B-matter and top are both held to agreed-upon lengths.

10. After filing top, reporters should always remain reachable until the newspaper goes to bed, in order to check facts.

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the Dec. 7, 2006 Herald News brown bag session recapping the recent <a href="http://www.asne.org/readership/younganddiverse" target="_new">ASNE Readership Seminar</a>
Led by Nathan Hale, Jean Stevens &amp; Suzanne Travers

A run-down of the brown bag highlights:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Age</strong>. We all must strive to include teenage and 20-something sources into our work. Why would young readers read our paper if they did not see themselves in it, or stories relating to their lives?  It even helps to brainstorm with young readers in mind. Tips include: what would I (as a young person) want to read? What would my kids want to read? Whatâs on their minds? Where do they go? What stresses them out? Would I BUY this paper to read THIS story? Who can I interview for this story who is a teenager or 20 something?</li>
	<li><strong>Editing for audience</strong>. Instead of an editor saying, 'What do we have for features today? News? Sports?', the editor would ask, what do we have for 18-34 year olds today? For college students? (We also learned at the conference that in the 18-34 age bracket, race/class differences are transcended by ageâ¦in other words, a 22-year-old white girl from Clifton has more in common with a 24-year-old Hispanic male from Passaic, than the girl does with a white 40-year-old).</li>
	<li><strong>Experience</strong>. We must strive to create an experience in stories, from every step of the reporting process (I like to think of it as âThe Starbucks factor.â) We should consider what stories will not just TELL readers the facts or TELL them a story, but allow them to FEEL a response to it, whether itâs humor, anger, surprise or âWow, that made me smarter.â Readers donât remember facts, they remember their responses, and they want to buy a product that gives them an experience (Why do we buy a $4 Starbucks latte? For the coffee house experience, the music, the lights, the mellow vibe, not just the coffee. Why should we buy a newspaper? For the in-the-know, funny, or what the? factor, not just the facts or the news). When brainstorming story ideas, while reporting, while writing and then during editing, experience must be key. Work with photo/design to maximize experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Headlines</strong>. We should work with headline writers to make sure the headlines hook the reader, through humor or witty brevity, and accurately reflect the story. Maybe reporters could suggest a clever (short!) headline for their stories as they file them.</li>
	<li><strong>Synergy</strong>, i.e. meeting with photographers and/or designers in the very beginning of the reporting process to help direct our reporting (for example, instead of writing a narrative about an unusual hair salon, instead, bring a photographer and take photos of 5 customers, write their stories in briefs, and then write a short story explaining the 5 Wâs of why this salon is unusual). This forces us to focus our reporting on the most interesting and appealing aspects of the story, keeping in mind how it will presented visually.</li>
	<li><strong>We need help!!</strong> We talked about how important it is to get editors, marketing directors, and all the head honchos of the company on board with the redevelopment process, as reporters can only do so much.</li>
</ul>
Hereâs a link to the seminar's readings, which we found very insightful and useful: <a href="http://www.readership.org/seminar/seminar.asp" target="_new">http://www.readership.org/seminar/seminar.asp</a>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The art of boxing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>When to use breakout boxes, charts, maps or other visuals</h2>
WHY?
It's pretty simple, really: Readers are visual animals. They're drawn to the stuff that catches their eye.
It's a proven fact that readers will consistently check out a story that has accoutrements more often than ones that don't, no matter how compellingly written the story.
Did that last part catch your attention? That's right â¦ all the time you spent crafting that oh-so-perfect lede could go to waste unless you've also spent some time mulling visual ways to draw a reader into your tale. Got photo? Locator map? Schematics? Illustration? Those will be handled in the graphics best practice.
But there's a simple and effective way to get visual with your story and do it all by yourself! Breakout boxes are one of the easiest ways to add a visual element to even the most run-of-the-mill story.

WHAT?
Breakout boxes can do three things:
<ol>
	<li> Add information that might otherwise bog down a story.</li>
	<li>Distill information for folks who don't want to read the full story.</li>
	<li>Include key information, like important dates and deadlines.</li>
</ol>
WHEN?
Virtually every story can - and should -- have a breakout box with it. We should strive to get the reader the information he needs in as many different formats as possible. If we only provide an 8-inch story, it's easier for him to pass over it and miss the information within. Add a breakout box, the odds tilt a little more in our favor. Add a blurb on the Web or a photo or map, and it's almost certain the reader will at least stop in.

Types of stories that should come with breakout boxes:
1. Budget stories (total revenue versus spending, tax rate, increase to average assessment, percentage increase year over year by department)
2.	Event stories (when, where will it be held? How much will it cost? Who'll be there?)
3.	Profiles (biographical information is a must whether it's a person or business, even a building)
4.	Council stories (What's the measure say? How did the vote come out?)
5.	Public service stories (What does the new law say? What does it mean?)
6.	Analysis stories (What happens next?)
7.	Trend stories (Where can I read more about this topic?)

WHERE?
Breakout boxes should always be a separate file, slugged the same as the story except add ".box" Breakout boxes must also be edited, so treat them as you would your story - read them twice before sending and CQ the information therein.

It's a fallacy that if you put information in a breakout box, you don't need it in the story.
So, what happens if the copy desk runs out of space and must cut the box?

HOW?
There are some good templates in Prestige. If you can't find a template that works, keep in mind these hints when creating your own box:
1.	All good breakout boxes have a headline
2.	Keep it short
3.	Make it interesting (writing a breakout is no different than a story; you need to draw readers in)
4.	Give it meat (make sure that it contains the critical "What does it mean to me?" information
5.	Source it (put your source on the bottom, just like you would a graphic)

<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the benefits of having no readers is that no one will be impatiently demanding that I have all my ducks in a row while I continue to get the new site up and running. I'd say I'm about 80 percent of the way there. I have a few design features I need to tweak (anybody notice that the word HOME disappears when you roll over it on the navigation bar? Any suggestions?), and some more background content to add before I'm completely happy with this site going forward. Once the backend is set, my hope is to post on here about once or twice a week.

That said, right now you can check out the <a href="/best-practices/">Best Practices</a> section. Today, I added about a dozen short write-ups I've collected over the years. That part of the site is intended as a repository of tips, techniques and guidelines for tasks many reporters are faced with. From how to cover a municipal beat, to how to cover a weather story, to some basic statistical analysis. A few of the beginner Best Practices are up right now. Over the next few weeks, I'll put up the rest of my archives. Enjoy.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In our rush to embrace the Web, it's interesting to keep in mind some of the limitations the medium could impose on journalists.

CNet News.com posted a story looking at how some of <a href="http://news.com.com/Newspaper+headlines+lost+in+Web+translation/2100-1025_3-6155618.html" title="Google to user: Drop Dead">history's best headlines</a> might not hack it in the digital age. Here's what they write about one of my favorites...
<blockquote>"<strong>Ford to city: Drop dead</strong>" -- New York Daily News reporting President Ford's denial of a federal bailout (1975)

[Internet search expert]: Would suggest "President Ford" over "Ford", and "New York City" over "City".</blockquote>

<title>The truth in numbers</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ As the newspaper industry struggles to ensure its relevance in the changing media landscape, there are a few pioneers out there who have the right idea. One of them, <a href="http://www.holovaty.com" target="_blank">Adrian Holovaty</a>, created the innovative <a href="http://chicagocrime.org/" target="_blank">ChicagoCrime.org</a> by databasing freely-available crime reports from the Web and mashing them up with Google Maps (more to come on mapping later...).

Now another innovator, the St. Pete Times' <a href="http://www.mattwaite.com/2007/08/22/announcing-politifact/" target="_blank">Matt Waite</a> has done something similar to measure the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness" target="_blank">truthiness</a> of next year's crop of presidential hopefuls. <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/" target="_blank">Politifact</a> is a Web site built on a growing database of political rhetoric, checked out with old-fashioned reporting. It's not only interesting and entertaining to see which candidates' <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/rulings/pants-fire/" target="_blank">pants are on fire</a>, but it proves that today's journalists will have a great future as newspapers evolve out of their current doldrums--if those intrepid aces can think about what readers' want and what they can actually use. I think Matt sums it up nicely:
<blockquote> "All the talk and all the focus lately in web journalism circles is on local, local, local and to some degree theyâre right. But thereâs also something to be said for just putting a good idea on the web that people might find useful."</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems the Internet has done as much for amateur cartographers as it has for budding pornographers.

As <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2007/08/22/the-truth-in-numbers/">I promised earlier</a>, I have a few resources to share on mapping, particularly of the Google Maps variety. I had actually been planning on posting this for the last few days, when I noticed <a href="http://analyticjournalism.blogharbor.com/blog/_archives/2007/8/15/3160819.html" target="_blank">this mention the Analytic Journalism blog</a> of Google's new feature that allows users to embed a personal Google Map into a Web blog using just a tiny snippet of HTML. This is a feature that's long overdue, and should make all of the hub-bub over <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/tag/mapping" target="_blank">map mash-ups</a> all the more accessible for the average user.

I almost wish they had offered such a feature last year when I made <a href="http://northjersey.com/static/maps/paterson_map_101506.html" target="_blank">my first Google Map</a>. I was writing an investigative project about the city of Paterson selling off its property tax liens against vacant lots to a third-party investor. I decided to take the database I had already built, and with a little help from Excel, I was able to add the lines of code that let me dump it into a map using the <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a>. Without ever having worked with an API in my life--just a little bit of rudimentary HTML--I was able to learn the code and whip up the map in the span of a couple days. Most of that time was spent on the hardest part: driving around town with a laptop on my passenger's seat and a photographer in the back taking pictures of each of the 160+ properties on the map. I thought it came out great.

Adding a Google Map to your story (or a Yahoo Map for that matter) is considerably easier than working with ArcGIS to produce the static maps you often see in the paper. And its a great Web feature that readers seem to dig. If you want to learn how to start tinkering with the API, here's a few good starter pages:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.econym.demon.co.uk/googlemaps/" target="_blank">Google Maps API tutorial</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://mapki.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Mapki: a Google Maps wiki</a></li>
	<li>The <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Google Maps Mania</a> blog</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://www.wotton.org/map/batchgeo.html" target="_blank">Google Maps geocoder</a> (which you need to determine the longitude and latitude points for the addresses you want to plot on a map.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://mapmaker.donkeymagic.co.uk/" target="_blank">Donkey Magic mapmaker</a> will help you create your map using next to no code. It writes the backend source code and you just cut and paste.</li>
</ul>
Also, here's a few other of my favorite recent mapping toys:
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/" target="_blank">Gmap Pedometer</a> helps you find routes (and distances between destinations) as the crow walks, block by block.  This is great for living in New York City. I use it to plot out <a href="http://del.icio.us/tommeagher/biking" target="_blank">my weekly bike rides</a> across the Outer Boroughs.</li>
	<li>Finally, <a href="http://www.batchgeocode.com/" target="_blank">BatchGeocode.com</a> is a great resource that I seem to use again and again for mapping projects large and small. If you have a lot of points (more than a few hundred), it can take some time, but it's free and it's easy, like all good maps (and graphics in general) should be.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[For weeks, I've been planning this post, my paean to Jack Kerouac and the influence he had (along with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Jack London, George Orwell and J.D. Salinger) on my early life as a writer.

But the hustle and bustle of daily journalism has once again thwarted my best intentions.

<a href="http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2007/09/05/941743-today-in-history-sept-5" target="_blank">50 years ago today</a>, Kerouac's "On the Road" was published. Reading it as a teenager--if only I could remember who had first handed me a copy--led me on an odyssey of discovering and devouring the subversive, onomatopoetic <em>oevre</em> of the Beat Generation and its writers. Since then, many others have surmounted Kerouac's primacy in my pantheon of literary gods, but I still hold a soft spot for him (and the dozens of editions of his books I still hoard).

<!--more-->

<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1405/1207598353_8ae7e6da0b.jpg?v=0" align="right" border="1" hspace="1" width="415" />

My desire to mimic Kerouac, and his brief stint as a sports reporter, led me to explore journalism as a career.

Then, my high school English teacher, with his heavy Southern accent and affinity for heavy suede workboots, spied me reading "On the Road" before class (it was not on the syllabus).

"Y'know," he said, "Ol' Jack drank hi'self to death back in '69."

That teacher turned me on to H.L. Mencken and taught me to write a news story.

A couple weeks ago, I rode my bicycle through Brooklyn and Queens to visit Kerouac's former apartment in Ozone Park. Over what is now a flower shop ("Little Shoppe of Flowers"...hilarious), he lived with his parents and wrote "The Town and the City". I believe it was also the apartment where his father died of stomach cancer, exacerbated by his drinking. On a busy morning, I rode through traffic on Crossbay Boulevard to visit the site. A man washed his ambulance on the street outside. He looked at me like I was crazy for taking a picture of the building and the small plaque next to the door:

So now, let me <a href="http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/he-was-a-very-lonely-man/" target="_blank">join</a> <a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18655982&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=576260&amp;rfi=6" target="_blank">the chorus</a> of writers who have come <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/31/joyce-johnson-jack-k.html" target="_blank">to praise Kerouac</a> and to bury him. Maybe it's time I picked up "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_of_Duluoz" target="_blank">Vanity of Duluoz</a>" or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Cassidy" target="_blank">Maggie Cassidy</a>" one more time. It's funny, the places these circuitous trails lead you.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I once heard an editor compare working in New Jersey to hunting in a game preserve. Much like their cousins in <a href="http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/" target="_blank">South Florida</a>, Jersey politicians never cease to provide a wealth of good stories.

A week or so ago, we got one of those stories when federal investigators launched <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkyMDA5" target="_blank">the latest</a> in their regular series of corruption arrests of politicians.

Of the dozen or so public officials arrested statewide on charges of accepting bribes, four come from our coverage area in Passaic County. Each was accused of taking thousands of dollars--one was to allegedly have his bribe wired to an account in the Dominican Republic after being laundered in Switzerland--in exchange for arranging municipal insurance and roofing contracts.

Since our City Editor departed for the snowy vistas of Minnesota last month, I've been filling in as an assistant editor on the desk. As this story broke about 9 a.m. on a Thursday, I got to really sink my teeth into managing this story. We deployed 11 of our 13 city desk reporters to cover the news. Then we wrangled another three reporters from the features desk to lend a hand.

We put out a barrage of stories in Friday's paper: from the <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkyMDA4" target="_blank">reaction of the constituents</a> to the immediate <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkxOTUx" target="_blank">political wrangling</a> that erupted over the pending election for the seat of the Assemblyman/Undersheriff/<a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkyMDA4" target="_blank">Clergyman</a> who was arrested. We also had a nice profile of the former professional wrestler and cop-turned-<a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkxOTcy" target="_blank">mayor</a> who got caught in the sting. Our lead piece used some of the text from the federal complaints and wiretaps to analyze the differing leadership styles of the <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkxOTg2" target="_blank">two arrested heavyweights</a> from our area.

And then at 3 p.m. on the same day, they shut down the entire school system in the city of Paterson for <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk0JmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkyMDAz" target="_blank">fire code violations</a>. So we had to scramble two more reporters to handle that story.

It was a great rush to work on a big breaking story from the other side of the assigning desk, moving reporters and resources around to handle the emerging threads of the news.  I got to chip in by doing some backgrounding of some of the arrested pols, but I didn't get to be as hands-on as I normally would. Thankfully, there will surely be more stories like this coming down the road.

And three days later, while working a weekend shift as a humble reporter,  I finally got my shot to write <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTkzNTM2" target="_blank">a piece of the story</a>.

So it goes.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Insert bad Cyndi Lauper pun here</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Although you probably wouldn't know it from the miniscule bit of coverage it has received thus far, the Women's World Cup (of soccer) is currently underway in China. Since I don't have cable at home, and the games have been broadcast in the middle of the night, I'm sad to say I haven't seen any of the play beyond the usual highlight clips on YouTube.

But I have been very interested in the small bit of very good writing about the tournament that has made its way back here. <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/" target="_blank">Steve Goff of the Washington Post</a> made the trip to China to follow the U.S. Women's National Team's exploits there, in the process offering a window into the East that we rarely get.

The stories that have captured my attention the most thus far are those that show the inequities that exist in world football. Even though few people really support the Americans here, they are the best team on the planet (rivaled perhaps only by Germany and, now, <a href="http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/the-selecao-feminina-from-no-respect-to-saviours-of-their-country/" target="_blank">Brazil</a>). Other nations treat their women's teams the same way Americans treat all professional soccer--like a second-class sport fit only for the Third World.

Probably the best story I've seen on the growing pains of women's football around the globe illustrates that better than most. It came in this excellent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu1CrkrQV_Q&amp;mode=related&amp;search=" target="_blank">Al-Jazeera English piece</a> on the slow rise of women's soccer in Egypt (thanks to the late-to-the-game-but-increasingly-great<a href="http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/" target="_blank"> Goal blog </a>by the NY Times for the clip). Perhaps it's unsurprising that no teams from the Middle East made it to China for this year's tournament.

So the U.S. Women will face off against the Brazilian Samba Queens Thursday in the Cup's semi-finals. A win against Brazil (nearly unthinkable for the men's squad), and the team will book a slot in the finals, likely against its nemesis Germany. I think there's really no downside to the expanding popularity, and skill, of the women's game. But as Steve Goff <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/2007/09/world_cup_prize_money.html" target="_blank">reported today</a> the glass ceiling isn't just an obstacle for women in corporate America. The winners of the Women's World Cup will receive a mere fraction of the prize money that the Italian men took home last summer.

As entertaining as the games in China may be, we've still got a long way to go.]]></content:encoded>

<title>A browser for data?</title>
<link>http://blog.tommeagher.com/2007/09/a-browser-for-data/</link>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[A friend just alerted me to <a href="http://www.kirix.com/" target="_blank">Kirix Strata</a>, a Web browser that will let you work with raw data as you see it on your favorite Web pages. You can easily manipulate html tables or create mash-ups with RSS feeds. This is an intriguing idea. I wonder if, like <a href="http://blog.swivel.com/" target="_blank">Swivel</a> (another new-fangled Internet contraption I haven't had the time to really explore yet), this will help democratize data analysis.

(Of course, <a href="http://www.depthreporting.com/2007/08/web-data-browser.html" target="_blank">Depth Reporting</a> had this tidbit more than a month ago, but I must have missed that post the first time around.)

These discoveries led me to a few questions:
<ul>
	<li>Have any of you had a chance to use either Kirix Strata or Swivel?</li>
	<li>What have you been able to do with these tools and would you recommend them for a harried journalist working with data?</li>
	<li>What pointers can you share to help a newbie get the most out of these applications?</li>
</ul>
I'd love to hear any feedback you have. Post a comment and let me know what you think.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the shameless self-promotion department, here's a couple of nice stories we ran this weekend that I had a hand in.

For the past couple of months, I've been editing full-time, so I haven't had a lot of bylines of late. But my <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2MCZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5NzIwMTM1MSZ5cmlyeTdmNzE3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTI=" target="_blank">latest project</a>, which I put together in conjunction with our intrepid cops reporter, looks at the worst intersections in our county for pedestrians.

It all started when I found that the New Jersey Department of Transportation posts all of its <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/" target="_blank">crash records</a>--the databases listing every accident in the state in which a report was filed--online. We took a look at the last six years to see what intersections have proved most dangerous, and deadly, for walkers and cyclists. Once I got the data, the hardest part was figuring out how to standardize the names of the intersections. One accident might be listed at Main and Market streets. The next accident would be listed at Market and Main streets, but they're really the same interesction. <a href="http://www.ire.org/membersonly/lists/NICAR-L/2007-07/msg00174.html" target="_blank">With a little help</a> from the everready <a href="http://nicar.org/" target="_blank">NICAR</a> listserv, I leapt over that hurdle and kept running.

We used the state DOT's formula for weighting the severity of each accident. Those with more serious injuries got a higher score. Those with a complaint of pain or simply property damage got a very low score. Then we just added up the scores for every accident at each intersection. Pretty straightforward, although it took us some time to pull it all together.

The product, a nice explainer piece for our readers, ran Sunday. Judging by the early chatter on the local message boards, forums and blogs, it seemed to get a good response from readers. It was accompanied by a cool<a href="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.northjersey.com/dngmedia/media_server/hn/2007/09/30pedestrians/index.html','_blank','width=600,height=485,status=1,scrollbars=0,resizable=0'));"> sound slides</a> that we put together with the help of our photo staff. Of course, there was also the de rigeur<a href="http://www.northjersey.com/static/maps/092307intersectionsmap.html" target="_blank"> Google map</a> showing the clusters of the worst intersections and highlighting the 12 where pedestrians have been killed by drivers since 2001.<a href="http://www.northjersey.com/static/maps/092307intersectionsmap.html" target="_blank">
</a>

Then, this morning, we ran a project that I had coached and edited from the beginning on the <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzNTkmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTcyMDIzNjYmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXky" target="_blank">dogfighting</a> underworld in New Jersey. Despite the headlines generated by Michael Vick's arrest and downfall over the summer, very few outlets really took the time to understand the allure of dogfighting and related blood sports like cockfighting.

Reporter Heather Haddon spent weeks cultivating sources to do just that, to get into the dogfighting landscape that is surprisingly popular here and to explain why thousands of people are attracted to it. I think she did a great job. I hope you agree.

Let me know what you think of these projects. Any reactions? Criticisms? Advice?]]></content:encoded>

<title>Two skills for the future</title>
<link>http://blog.tommeagher.com/2007/10/two-skills-for-the-future/</link>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's been a lot of hand-wringing in recent years about the bleak future of journalism in general and of newspapers in particular.

There are two skills that I believe are now indispensable in the field. Any journalist who won't begin to embrace them is simply not ready for the future of the business. What are they? Computer-assisted reporting and Spanish (or any other second language, for that matter).

Very few news organizations or journalism programs have invested resources into teaching their journalists these skills. How are you supposed to learn them, then? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">DIY</a>!

Not everyone has the time or money to attend one of <a href="http://www.ire.org/training/otr.php">IRE's excellent training sessions</a>. Thankfully people like my colleague Christopher Schnaars at <a href="http://www.northjersey.com">The Record</a> have pulled together some resources for you to learn on your own (<em>stage whisper: thanks to <a href="http://www.depthreporting.com/2007/10/free-excel-training-course-at-reporters.html" target="_blank">Depth Reporting</a> for pointing this out</em>).  Schnaars has a great, <a href="http://www.forjournalists.com/cookbook/media/ExcelTraining.zip">four-part course</a> on learning to use the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program. This is not <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4sOFVAR87I" target="_blank">C++ GUI programming</a>. These are basic skills that every reporter in the newsroom can and should master. Do yourself a favor and work through Schnaar's lessons. You'll find them endlessly helpful in your reporting and editing. If you want to keep going after that, then the <a href="http://forjournalists.com/cookbook/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">Reporter's Cookbook</a> will point you to the help you need.

Personally, I've got the CAR skills, and now I'm turning my attention to learning a new language. Thank you, <a href="http://www.clifton.k12.nj.us/adulteducation.asp" target="_blank">Clifton High School's adult education night classes</a>. You should look at night schools and community colleges in your area for similarly-affordable options. I'm about a third of the way through an elementary Spanish class. To gauge my progress, you can see this short exchange I wrote myself:
<blockquote>"Â¿Como esta?"
"No rapido, pero de acuerda."</blockquote>
If my very, very rudimentary Spanish is off the mark, which it likely is, allow me to translate.
<blockquote>"How is it?" (meaning my progress in learning Spanish)
"Not fast, but OK."</blockquote>
You've got to learn to walk before you can run. Good luck.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my grammatical pet peeves is the abuse of quotation marks. I see it often in my daily life, but as I've been editing lately,  I've noticed it popping up more and more in the stories I coach. A lot of young reporters think that quoting just one word an official says lends their story some kind of credibility. What they fail to realize is that the technique has the opposite effect. It either confuses the reader or suggests that the writer intends to use the quote sarcastically.

So I was thrilled this morning when I discovered (through the help of the ever-resourceful <a href="http://www.depthreporting.com/" target="_blank">Depth Reporting</a>) the <a href="http://quotation-marks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">"Blog" of "unnecessary" quotation marks</a>. Hopefully this will help me make my argument that it's often better to avoid the gratuitous quotation marks as if they were "air quotes". Enjoy.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Editing 'Saints of the Storm'</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been out of the daily reporting loop for months now as I fill in as an editor, but I have been involved in one cool project. One of my reporters is now in the Dominican Republic reporting <a target="_blank" href="http://myheraldnews.com/saints.html">a project</a> on the destruction caused earlier in the month by Hurricane Noel. While she's there (without a laptop, cellphone charger or camera cord--"lost" by the airline), I'm editing her copy and coordinating the project with the Web, photo, copy and marketing staffs.

Yesterday she was in the town of Piedra Blanca, an agricultural outpost of about 23,000 people that was devastated by the storm. Paterson, NJ has the highest population of Dominicans in the state and many of our readers hail from Piedra Blanca. They led Heather to this great story.
<blockquote>"We're starting at zero," said Dr. Carmen Garcia, the mayor of Piedra Blanca, while sitting in her sparse office on Tuesday. "This destroyed everything."</blockquote>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.northjersey.com/dr">The series</a> will drop the next stories on Saturday and Monday with more to follow next week. It will be definitely worth a read if you're interested in how new Americans return home to help their countrymen in need.

In the middle of juggling all the demands of launching this project yesterday, I did get to do a piece of data reporting. I actually managed to squeeze in an opportunity to run some SQL queries on a New Jersey accidents database for a reporter looking for some key data. She was looking for the number of accidents involving school buses in Passaic County over the last five years. I was quite pleased with myself that I could run the queries and find her answer in about 15 minutes. The number? 713.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My former colleague <a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/" target="_blank">Yoni Greenbaum</a> has entered the journalism blogging arena, and he recently added his <a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/?p=64" target="_blank">philosophy</a> about the obligation of newspapers to make their corrections as easy to find online as they are in the print edition.

As a longtime fan of <a href="http://www.regrettheerror.com/" target="_blank">Regret the Error</a>, I couldn't agree more. Look, nobody wants to make a mistake, particularly when reporters, editors and photographers have spent months on an investigation. A silly bit of carelessness can sully the credibility of the entire story. But what would be even more damaging for the journalists involved, and particularly for their newspaper, would be to soft-pedal the needed correction.

If you get it wrong, say so. Say it soon and say it straightforward. Being forthright with readers about any errors--of omission or otherwise--will reap dividends in the long-run.

As newspapers build up more vigorous online presences, it only becomes more vital that they revisit their correction policies for their Web editions. Make it visible and be honest, and you will build even more loyalty for your product. A little <em>mea culpa</em> will go a long way.]]></content:encoded>

<title>There's always room for another two cents.</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[While I use <a href="http://news.google.com/" target="_blank">Google News</a> fairly regularly--particularly its e-mailed news alerts), I never noticed the new "comments from people in the news" function that it apparently launched last spring. It's a fascinating idea that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/24/business/media/24link.html?_r=2&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=login&amp;oref=slogin" target="_blank">NY Times</a> recently took a look at (thanks, <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/26/1246246&amp;from=rss" target="_blank">Slashdot</a> for bringing it to my attention).

Let's set aside for a moment the daunting challenges of trying to make this work in the real world. Why shouldn't news subjects have a chance to comment on a story in which they appear, particularly on the Web where the column inches are infinite? Certainly sources have already taken advantage of the comment functions that many news organizations' Web sites already employ. But Google has hit upon a unique twist by weighting the comments from those quoted in a story. The journalist has already gone to the effort of vetting sources and weeding out those with less substantial thoughts to add to a story. To give them a chance to comment after the fact and append it to the story can only add to the depth of the coverage.

It's conceivable that you could give every source you interview a special URL and a password. Once the story appears in the paper, they could then choose to login and sound off. It would assuage the bruised egos of those long-winded subjects who inevitably lose much of their argument to brevity. It would also keep reporters on their toes that they could expect more than a nasty letter to the editor should they play fast and loose with the facts.

What do you think? Is there any reason we as journalists couldn't (or shouldn't) provide such a function on our own Web sites? Or should we let Google have all the fun?]]></content:encoded>

<title>Must crawl before walking.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been putting off posting here for weeks, hoping inspiration would strike, or I would suddenly find a bounty of free time to think of something really insightful.

None of thisÂ happened, so I'll drop a few tidbits of news and links to some friends, and hope I can get things rolling here again shortly.

First, I'm no longer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myheraldnews.com/">my paper's</a> CAR reporter. Last month, I was promoted to city editor. I can just hear you, in your best <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gotwavs.com/php/sounds/?id=gog&amp;media=WAVS&amp;type=Movies&amp;movie=Big_Lebowski&amp;quote=achievers.txt&amp;file=achievers.wav">Maude Lebowski tone</a>, saying to yourself "And proud we are of you...". Yes, it's a nice new job to throw me back at the bottom ofÂ a steep learning curve. Thankfully, some friends have been giving me <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080108/a-crowdsourcing-experiment/">some advice</a>.

So for the time being, let me just say I promise to post again soon. There's loads of cool and exciting things happening on the Web that should make journalists <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wiredjournalists.com">informed</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.everyblock.com">nervous </a>(in a good way, like a roller-coaster ride). They should keep you busy for a bit.

Â And let me pass on a couple of old nuggets from a former editor: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20071214/agoraphobics-in-your-newsroom/">get out of the newsroom</a>, and use your e-mail addressbook as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080113/newsletters-your-secret-to-developing-sources/">a way to cultivate sources</a>.

So stop obsessing over this season of "The Wire" and step up your game, people. I'm trying to.

Cheers.]]></content:encoded>

Plenty of <a href="http://www.theenergyindependent.com/jonathan-evan-maslow/jonathan-evan-maslow-1948-2008.html" target="_blank">others</a> have <a href="http://www.capemaycountyherald.com/article/21803-former-herald-reporter-jonathan-e-maslow-59" target="_blank">already</a> shared their memories and their sadness <a href="http://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080220/journalism-mourns-a-loss/" target="_blank">much better</a> than I can.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some people spend years trying to learn our craft, spending thousands on graduate schools. Others just go where the news is, roll up their sleeves and give it a shot.

I can't say that my friend David Lang's method is the best way to get into the business, but it's not the craziest either. <a href="http://davidlang.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">David</a> is an accomplished photographer who has been learning the craft of making pictures for some time, but this winter he went out on a limb. He flew to Pakistan for a month to cover the presidential elections there and to explore Afghanistan.

So now, camera and lights in hand, David is having a hell of an adventure, and he's no longer just a documentary photographer. He's a journalist. <a href="http://davidlang.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">His blog</a> about his experiences in the 'stans is funny, engaging and definitely worth a read.

<title>Free Barry Bearak</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[From time to time, you read about journalists being imprisoned in far-off countries for doing their jobs. Only rarely do you recognize their names.

Yesterday, Barry Bearak of the New York Times was arrested in Zimbabwe and accused ofÂ  "<a target="_blank" href="http://http://www.cpj.org/news/2008/africa/zim04apr08na2.html">practicing journalism without accreditation</a>". I made Bearak's acquaintance a few years ago when he was teaching at Columbia University's journalism school. I've since become a fan of his work. He's a gifted and probing writer who has won the Pulitzer Prize, the highest honor in American journalism.

I heard about Bearak's arrest this morning on the BBC. I can't profess to know all the ins and outs of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/world/africa/04zimbabwe.html?_r=1&amp;st=cse&amp;sq=bearak&amp;scp=1&amp;oref=slogin">situation in Zimbabwe</a>, but I know that Bearak is a journalist of integrity. I hope that Barry is safe and sound and released quickly.

It's an outrage that any government would jail a journalist for doing his job. A lot of people like to grouse about the American news media and accuse it of rampant bias. But situations like these only reinforce how vital an unfettered press is to a true democracy.

<strong>Update: </strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/world/africa/08bearak.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=bearak&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin">Bearak was freed on bail Monday</a>. Hopefully, his case will help shine a light on the persecution of journalists and restrictions on the free flow of information in Zimbabwe. Maybe that light can help the people there make a change.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those very few of you who have been missing my byline (hi, Mom and Dad!), I have good news. The Herald News' soccer writer, <a href="http://www.soccerbyives.net" target="_blank">Ives Galarcep</a>, has gone rogue and left the paper to start his own soccer media empire. Since his departure, I have been tapped to write our paper's soccer blog. Last week, we launched <a href="http://www.myheraldnews.com/fixture" target="_blank">The International Fixture</a>. It's a chance for me to write about the culture and passion of soccer's players and supporters. The blog will hopefully focus on the game around the world and how it resonates with people in the North Jersey and New York City area.

So if you're at all interested in the beautiful game, stop by and check it out. It's a hobby that I'll try to squeeze in when my regular editing responsibilities allow, but I think it will be a fun chance to write about one of my favorite pasttimes. We'll see how it goes.

For those who aren't soccer aficionados, don't despair. I'll keep sharing my tips and experiences in the newspaper business here on my personal site, as well.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I read a lot of nonfiction, <a href="http://brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book_id/970" target="_blank">literary</a> and <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/10/03/woodward/index_np.html" target="_blank">otherwise</a>, and I recently finished one of the better books I've found on American culture and media in the middle of the 20th Century. "<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7096480" target="_blank">The Race Beat</a>" not only chronicles the coverage of the civil rights movement and its effects on American society, it offers a few good lessons on being a journalist.

Here's my favorite:
<blockquote>"One other thing made <a href="http://www.pbs.org/weta/reportingamericaatwar/reporters/bigart/" target="_blank">Bigart</a> memorable: he spoke with a stammer that colleagues frequently saw him use to his benefit to coax information from reluctant sources.

<a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/11547/index1.html" target="_blank">Lelyveld</a>, sent to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Civil_Rights_Workers_Murders" target="_blank">Philadelphia</a> after Bigart, met a local minister, introduced himself, and interviewed the minister. He came away with an unforgettable lesson in what it takes to be a great newspaper reporter.

"'You've asked me a lot of questions,' the minister said in a buttery southern accent after the interview was over. 'Can I ask you one?'

"'Yes sir', Lelyveld responded.

"'There was a man down here, an older man, said <em>he</em> was from <a href="http://www.southerner.net/v1n3_99/gaytalese.html" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Name of Bigaht. Know 'im?'

"'Yes sir.'

"'Couldn't have a normal conversation with that man,' the minister went on. 'He didn't know anything. I had to explain <strong><em>evvvverything</em></strong> to him.'"</blockquote>
Not a bad M.O. if you can pull it off. We can all learn from the old masters.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nature of the news business, and the 24/7 demand of following <a href="http://njmg.typepad.com/fixture/" target="_blank">the world of futbol</a>, keeps me more than busy much of the time. Thus, this little professional blog ends up taking a back seat until the spirit moves me.</p><p>I know it's been awhile, and summer has already sprinted past us, but here's a quick update. Now that school's back in session, I have one more responsibility to add to my plate. This semester, I'm the North Jersey Media Group fellow at <a href="http://www.fdu.edu/" target="_blank">Fairleigh Dickinson University</a>. As part of the fellowship, I'm teaching  <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/dataclass/">an introductory course in CAR</a> for students at the campus that straddles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackensack_River" target="_blank">the lazy Hackensack River</a>.</p><p>The semester has barely begun, but so far I'm enjoying working with my tiny class. The students seem curious and eager to learn about working with Excel and databases, even if it's not quite clear to them yet what to do with it all. I think this will be a good chance for me to practice my classroom demeanor. And hopefully it'll give me the impetus to make some more headway on fleshing out the <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/best-practices/" target="_blank">Best Practices</a> section.</p><p>What advice do you have for me as I strive to teach the next generation of journalists and writers?</p></p>]]></content:encoded>

Many taxpayers complain about conventions and junkets that public employees go on each year. For this fun story, I pored through piles of travel expense reports and receipts I received through an open public records request to show how Paterson officials were spending taxpayer money at conventions in Atlantic City.

In the wake of a corruption scandal in Paterson's Section 8 office, we looked at how the federal rental subsidy program was being administered locally. I built a database of Paterson's Section 8 payment records and the properties offered to needy renters in the program. By mapping the properties against Census data, we were able to demonstrate that Paterson officials steered voucher recipients into the poorest neighborhoods in the city, in opposition to the intent and regulations of the federal program.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When Michelle Jamison and her family lost their apartment in a fire, they were given a list of Section 8 properties by the city to find a new place.
âThe list that they gave us was all horrible areas â all in the 4th Ward,â Jamison said. Jamison said she questioned why the city agency, seeing that she had a teenage daughter, would only recommend what she considered high-crime areas... âThey said thatâs what they had available, and this was their list, and pretty much take it or leave it." </em><a href="/files/clips/sec8map.pdf" target="_new">The full story</a>

I wanted to find a compelling way to illustrate the challenges that face the working poor and immigrants in North Jersey. For one month, I gave up all my money, moved out of my apartment and got a low-wage job. The resulting story of how I made ends meet resonated with readers across the socioeconomic spectrum, won several state contests and was a finalist in the Deadline Club's annual awards.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In just two days, my $424 dwindled to $110. It all adds up: jitney rides to look for apartments, phone cards to answer job ads.

After covering the city of Paterson for more than 18 months, I had developed the kind of sources that make a story like this possible. Several officials and employees tipped me off and then related a discussion that took place in a confidential, closed-door council session about a longtime city lawyer fired for harassing a secretary at a public meeting. The incident ended up costing the cash-strapped city hundreds of thousands of dollars.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Alston, who serves as secretary to Council President Kenneth M. Morris, Jr., alleged that Gordon removed his shoes during a meeting to run his feet up and down her leg under the council table.</em> <a href="/files/clips/footsy.pdf" target="_blank">The full story</a></p>

One morning, while covering a court case, a lawyer whispered to me, "Did you hear what they found at the Meadowlands?" (Not Jimmy Hoffa's body) I raced back to the newsroom and broke this story,  beating the state's two major dailies. This case of unsecured, hazardous chemicals sitting along the rail lines was a timely warning from a neighboring town that came just as similar rail transfer stations were popping up in our area.

Paterson is the kind of failed industrial town that has bred generations of poverty and violence, gangs and drugs. I found a young filmmaker whose work both chronicled and helped to define the city's street life. The irony was that Rob Jackson hoped that the success of his homemade DVDs would allow him to escape the crime and violence his films banked on.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>His camera bounced erratically and leapt out of focus. Lit only by street lamps, he stopped in the middle of an intersection to capture a shot of the loser curled up on the ground as three acquaintances punched and kicked him.

<a href="http://eliotcaroom.com/" target="_blank">One of my reporters </a>had begun looking at a local sewer authority that serves a number of the towns in his municipal beat. The sewer rates kept going up each year, and some town officials complained that a promised new power plant was way behind schedule. With the help of background sources, the writer dug deep into internal audits and memos that showed the body's professional staff believed that $30 million had been wasted on the power plant that would never operate. It took weeks to bulletproof the story, but it provided a good service for the sewer ratepayers in 14 towns across two counties.

A freelancer pitched a story about a popular new chain of ultracheap thrift stores popping up in former big box locations around New Jersey. As she dug into the story and got deeper, she realized there was more to it. The thrift chain was using charities to solicit donations. In turn, it paid the charities pennies on the dollar for goods that it resold to bargain-hunters, without disclosing to donors or shoppers the relationship. The reporter dug through federal tax and corporate filings and state charity records to piece together the complex business dealings of the company and its non-profit partners.

Looking for stories about people who live in her beat, <a href="http://www.niccorbett.com" target="_blank">my reporter</a> found a Google News item that mentioned in passing the arrest of a teenager accused of attacking the Church of Scientology's website. No one had covered his trial in federal court, where he was the only person who pleaded guilty to participating in an online war between a group of hackers and Scientology. She dug into the young man's voluminous online activities, sifted through court documents and interviewed experts in the case to piece together how a childish prank landed the college student in prison for a year.

When Hurricane Noel hit in the fall of 2007, it ravaged the Dominican Republic. Paterson, N.J. has one of the largest Dominican expatriate communities in the U.S., and its residents jumped to collect donations and supplies for relief. <a href="http://www.heatherhaddon.com/" target="_blank">One of my reporters</a> tapped into a group of local Dominicans headed to the island to help, and she tagged along. On her first overseas reporting experience, she lost her suitcase en route. When she arrived, she reported and wrote this story in a day and a half, transmitting it via email over a dial-up internet connection threatened by sporadic power outages. The edited story turned out to be a great tale.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The 31-year-old scrambled to his roof. As the water rose, he clung to the branches of a nearby avocado tree to keep from being swept away.

Before going to the Dominican Republic, my reporter had heard concerns about a town with a baseball stadium that regularly hosted barnstorming Paterson teams.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The stadium here, with its manicured outfield and roofed bleachers, was the pride of this rural province....

<title>When all eyes are on India</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been trying to get to this post for about a week, but the news cycle has been a bear lately.

Here in Passaic County, we got hit by a major news story last week, and in the process of overseeing our coverage, I rediscovered a fantastic resource I wanted to share.

On Nov. 23, a gunman walked into a Syrian Orthodox Church in Clifton, N.J. looking for his estranged wife. Police say the man shot three people in their heads before he fled, killing his wife and another parishioner and critically injuring his wife's cousin.

It was a sad story, and our coverage on that Sunday and in the <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/United_by_faith_fate.html" target="_blank">subsequent days</a> revealed a small, tight-knit <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/Sect_sees_arranged_marriages_as_vital.html" target="_blank">community of Christians</a> here that is made up predominantly of immigrants from the southern Indian state of Kerala. (Unfortunately, the relaunch of our Web site this week wiped out about six other stories we wrote)<a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/Sect_sees_arranged_marriages_as_vital.html" target="_blank">
</a>

Pretty quickly after the shootings, parishioners who were in the church gave our reporters the name of the man they thought was the shooter (and <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/Accused_church_killer_due_in_court.html" target="_blank">who was arraigned in court today</a>). I found his phone number in California, and we called it. The woman who answered the phone didn't speak English, only malayalam, the language used in Kerala. I wondered how I could find a translator on a Sunday evening.

Then I remembered that for the past four years I've been a member of the <a href="http://www.saja.org/" target="_blank">South Asian Journalists Association</a> or SAJA. I was ashamed I didn't think of it sooner. So I sent an e-mail to another member looking for help. Within 15 minutes, I got a phone call from someone willing to do some on-the-fly translation through a conference call.

When we called California again, perhaps unsurprisingly, no one answered. But I was pleased by the help that SAJA was willing to offer. Then one of its members <a href="http://www.sajaforum.org/2008/11/crime-fatal-shootings-at-kerala-church-in-nj.html#comments" target="_blank">posted about our story</a> on the group's South Asian issues blog, <a href="http://www.sajaforum.org/" target="_blank">SAJAforum</a>. The comments that the forum's readers left in response to the story helped our staff members find new avenues of reporting in the following days. It was an indescribable boon.

I was truly impressed with the resources SAJA had assembled and the collegiality and professionalism of its members as they offered advice and help with our story. I was sold on renewing my membership.

Then, a couple days later, the <a href="http://www.sajaforum.org/mumbai-attacks/" target="_blank">terrorist attacks in Mumbai</a> happened. Since then, SAJA has gone into overdrive.  SAJAforum has offered loads of tips, including daily podcasts and phonecasts. With its coverage of this event, SAJAforum has proven itself an indispensable resource for anyone seriously covering South Asian news, both here and abroad. I can't recommend it enough.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As with many things on this site, it's taken me a little while to get around to posting this note.

In February, after a very successful stint at the Herald News--which included helping to lead it to win the award for best small daily in the state from the <a href="http://njpa.org/njpa/better_newspaper_contest/2008/2008%20Editorial%20Results%20-%20Daily.pdf" target="_blank">New Jersey Press Association</a>--I left to join a start-up newsroom. (Alas, I also left behind my neglected soccer blog) Now I am one of the news editors at the New Jersey Local News Service. Owned by <a href="http://www.advance.net/index.ssf?/advance_publications/about_advance_publications.html" target="_blank">Advance Publications</a>, we have a team of 15 reporters who cover municipal beats across six counties here in the Garden State.

On top of that, as part of <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2008/09/10/back-to-school/">my fellowship</a> at Fairleigh Dickinson, I've been taking a course this spring on Web programming, specifically with ASP.net. I've also been lucky enough to play a good amount of soccer and DJ a couple of times with friends.

At a time when many newspapers are convulsing or collapsing, working for LNS has been a really unique opportunity to help build a news gathering outfit from the ground up. We provide all of our stories to the Newark Star-Ledger and its Web site <a href="http://www.nj.com/" target="_blank">NJ.com</a>. So far, we've been having a blast. I have a feeling that we're going to see more news organizations following this model: start an outside company to focus intensely on local news and provide content for print and online. It'll be great to set the precedent for how it can be done.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Things have been pretty hectic over the last year. The Local News Service is fully staffed and running at full steam. Over the summer, we had a baby. Between the two, I've had my hands full.

Earlier this week, I was invited to speak on a panel to address the faculty at Columbia University's <a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Graduate School of Journalism</a>. It gave me the opportunity to reflect on LNS' first 10 months of operation and what I've learned. Here's a draft of my scripted remarks:

<!--more-->
<blockquote><strong>What's changing, and what isn't, in newsrooms today?</strong>

Let me start first with a little bit of background, because I get a lot of questions about what the Local News Service is and how it's related to the Star-Ledger.

In 2008, the Star-Ledger lost about 45 percent of its staff through a massive buyout. Its parent company, <a href="http://www.advance.net/index.ssf?/advance_publications/about_advance_publications.html" target="_blank">Advance Publications</a>, decided to set up a separate company to provide local news. This was not unprecedented. For years, the Ledger's high school sports and obituaries have been done <a href="http://www.oldnewark.com/memories/newspapers/reporter/footnoteone.htm" target="_blank">by an outside outfit</a>.

<a href="http://www.njlns.com" target="_blank">LNS</a> was launched last year to create a new cost structure and to fill the local pages of the <a href="http://www.nj.com/starledger/" target="_blank">Star-Ledger</a> and its website, <a href="http://www.nj.com" target="_blank">NJ.com</a>.

We have a newsroom of 15 reporters and 3 photographers covering municipal, local and breaking news in the six core counties of the Star-Ledger's coverage area. Three experienced editors, including myself and Rick Everett (retired Star-Ledger managing editor), offer direction, context and guidance.

We have an additional nine or 10 staffers who produce 26 listing calendars a week as well as community news items, Scouting and schools news and a history column.

Our purpose is to produce more content for print and online with fewer, less experienced journalists. At the same time, we want to maintain the same quality and standards that readers expect of the state's biggest newspaper. And we've done just that. Our photographers and reporters produce a ton of copy. We have helped bolster the Ledger's zoned county sections, and on occasion, we've contributed stories to the features, business and sports sections. And while our primary objective is local news, we've also snagged 27 front page stories and probably twice as many Jersey section cover pieces since we went live in March.

Along the way, I've observed a few things:

The competition is changing. Our old enemies have become our new friends as we join to fight new enemies. We now compete online with dozens of hyperlocal websites (<a href="http://www.patch.com" target="_blank">Patch</a>,Â <a href="http://www.baristanet.com/" target="_blank">Baristanet</a>, <a href="http://www.maplewoodonline.com/" target="_blank">Maplewood Online</a>, <a href="http://maplewood.blogs.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">The Local</a>, etc) as well as our old print foes from the Gannett papers. At the same time, the Ledger has largely buried the hatchet with its old rival the Bergen <a href="http://www.northjersey.com" target="_blank">Record</a>,Â and they now share most stories and have a combined statehouse bureau in Trenton.

Everything is faster. When we get a breaking news tip, we want to get it confirmed and get a short version of the story online immediately, if not sooner. The pace is picking up.

Our news gatherers are young. Only one of the 15 we hired was over 30. This has resulted in the loss of some institutional memory. In many cases, the veterans who had been in the Ledger's county bureaus for decades are gone. Some are now working as spokesmen for various state and local agencies and private companies. But they have been replaced, by and large, by ambitious and energetic reporters who know little to nothing about New Jersey and its stories. It has been a challenge for us to fill those gaps while our reporters cover, in some cases, 10 or more towns.

Although our reporters are sophisticated Web consumers and are comfortable with blogging, Facebook, shooting photos and even producing videos, there is no replacement for basic reporting skills. The most important thing I need from a new reporter is the ability to ask questions and chase a story. It does me no good if you can make a sound slide or build a web page if you can't find a story, ask questions and get it right. I've also noticed that as great as it is, Google has almost grown too popular. I have a reporter who rather than check the Star-Ledger's own, comprehensive online archives when looking for old clips, she will instead just Google it and see what hits come up from NJ.com. She doesn't even go to her own website to look for stories.

All this turmoil and change has been a very tough transition for readers. Our sources, particularly our favorite gadflies and midlevel local bureaucrats, have found this very confusing. They had been used to, in many cases, dealing with the same reporters for a decade or more. They knew who to call when there was news. Now they don't know who covers what. We have gone to great lengths to get our name out there. We've sent our reporters to as many meetings and events as we can in our towns to schmooze residents and officials and explain we're a new operation and get our faces out there.

All of this is, however, exciting. We have a great time doing what we do. Our reporters, because they haven't been poisoned by the malaise that afflicts many news organizations, really enjoy their jobs. We have fun going into work every day and chasing the news. We get excited when one of our people gets a front page story.

In many ways, even as business models evolve, the work we do as journalists every day hasn't changed all that much. We have better tools to work with in some cases, and we've got to do more, faster, but at the end of the day, it's journalism. I couldn't be happier.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few months ago, I was laid up for a few days recovering from knee surgery. I spent most of the time lounging on the sofa and watching European soccer games on <a href="http://www.espn3.com" target="_blank">ESPN3.com</a>. But I also stumbled upon a great series of podcasts that walked me through how and why journalists shouldÂ bushwhackÂ into the social media frontier.

The programs, essentially a series of lo-fi internet radio call-in shows, were hosted byÂ <a href="http://www.sree.net/" target="_blank">Sree Sreenivasan</a>, dean of student affairs at Columbia University's <a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1165270051346/page/1175295297393/JRNHomePage.htm" target="_blank">Graduate School of Journalism</a>. Like everyone else on the planet, I had been <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2008/11/getting-social-networked/" target="_self">dabbling in Facebook</a>, and I had heard a lot about Twitter but didn't understand how to use either very well, particularly as a journalist.

So I charged through <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/profile.aspx?userurl=columbiajournalism  " target="_blank">Sree's programs</a> (mostly using Google's excellent <a href="http://listen.googlelabs.com/" target="_blank">Listen app</a> on my Android phone). The most helpful were the episodes on <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2010/02/05/basic-twitter-for-journalists" target="_blank">Basic Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2009/09/18/facebook-for-journos" target="_blank">Facebook</a> for journalists. They gave some practical, but simple background on each service and shared advice from other working professionals. It was enough to make me feel comfortable experimenting.

Then I went to pick up more of the episodes, which coveredÂ topics likeÂ <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2009/02/06/launching-your-own-media-business" target="_blank">launching your own media company</a>, <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2009/10/15/google-docs-for-journalists" target="_blank">using Google Docs in reporting</a> and what exactly <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/columbiajournalism/2009/01/23/linkedin-for-journalists" target="_blank">are we supposed to do with LinkedIn</a>?

The audio quality wasn't crystal clear, but the medium was simple and straightforward. Before finding these, I was addicted to my RSS feeds, checking each one religiously throughout the work day. I now can go three or four days without even remembering to open Google Reader.

Instead, with Twitter I have this incredible, if sometimes overwhelming, stream of information coming at me in (often) clever, funny snippets. And with its open, collaborative nature, it's far more likely that I'll be turned on to new, engaging news sources and writers than I ever would find by reading hundreds of individual blogs. I've found about a hundred writers covering media issues, food, beer, film, television and soccer to follow on Twitter and to keep me abreast of the news and ideas of the day. Particularly for a news junkie, it's a great advance.

As I've gotten more comfortable with the service, I've experimented with a couple of Twitter management programs that help me more easily handle the onslaught of information.Â <a href="http://seesmic.com/" target="_blank">Seesmic</a> has a half-decent app for Android phones, but I've settled on usingÂ <a href="http://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a> (also on Sree's advice). It's got a great web interface that allows you to manage not only Twitter, but also LinkedIn, Facebook and Myspace accounts, and its Android app is easy and attractive.

If you're curious about this whole Twitter phenomenon in particular, I'd recommend checking out Sree's podcasts and then peruse his exhaustiveÂ <a href="http://sreetips.tumblr.com/post/87435969/twitter" target="_blank">Twitter guide for skeptics and newbies</a>. If you decide to sign up (or if you're already there), let me know so that I can start following your work too.

<title>No cheering in the press box</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As anyone who's stumbled upon myÂ <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ultracasual/" target="_blank">Twitter feed</a> can tell you, I'm a soccer fan whose zeal for the sport approaches fanaticism. But over the last 15 years, I've driven myself crazy trying to find news about the professional game in all its domestic incarnations, whether it be <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com" target="_blank">Major League Soccer</a>, <a href="http://www.womensprosoccer.com/" target="_blank">Women's Professional Soccer</a> or one of the <a href="http://www.ussoccer.com/USSF-D2-Pro-League/USSF-D2-Pro-League.aspx" target="_blank">lower divisions</a>.

I make my living editing local news--town councils, zoning boards, school boards--for a daily newspaper. It's been doubly frustrating for me then that a large majority of my colleagues in the media consider soccer to be a third-class sport.

By and large, soccer is ignored or, at best, squirreled away among the agate results, somewhere behind junior high water polo.Â Much has been written in the blogosphere about how soccer is a sportÂ <a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/2010/03/some-thoughts-on-internet-and-football.html" target="_blank">tailor-made for the internet</a>. With the advent over the past couple of years of prevalent, cheap and quick streaming video, anyone can now watch live games from around the world. You don't need broadcasters to watch the game. And you don't need your major metropolitan daily newspaper to read about it.

Frustrated by the willful ignorance of newspapers and TV, soccer fans like me have created their own media. Blogs, webzines, podcasts and other online publications have proliferated, sustained by fans who weren't getting the news and analysis they wanted. In many ways, American fans have provided a perfect example of the "citizen journalism" movement thatÂ <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Jarvis</a> has been preaching about all these years.

It's been great to see the level of engagement by so many regular fans, but I still find myself yearning for more. I want deeper reporting, better writing and smarter analysis. I want it all packaged in an attractive design, and I want more of it every day. I daydream about a soccer publication that embodies some of the best values of newspaper journalism infused with all the potential of the digital realm.

<h2>A familiar refrain</h2>
Many of the better critics and writers in the soccer blogosphere have tackled this subject before. I'm certainly not alone.Â <a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/" target="_blank">A More Splendid Life</a>,Â <a href="http://pitchinvasion.net/" target="_blank">Pitch Invasion</a>,Â <a href="http://www.thisisamericansoccer.com/" target="_blank">This is American Soccer</a> and others far more clever and thoughtful than me have bemoaned the same problem. A lot of readers want better coverage of the sport, on both the professional and amateur levels. But there are so few opportunities to makeÂ <a href="http://pitchinvasion.net/blog/2009/11/18/the-sweeper-the-future-of-soccer-journalism-debate/" target="_blank">a living at soccer writing</a>, it's difficult to expect anyone to answer the Siren call as anything more than a hobby.

The problem begins with the big mainstream purveyors of sports journalism, the newspapers and magazines that have traditionally funded serious and ongoing reporting. They won't, for the most part, touch soccer. Sure, we'll see a few features between now andÂ <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/" target="_blank">July 11</a>, but that's about it. At many publications, if they even have a soccer writer, he or she is pretty far down in the newsroom pecking order. They're lucky if their stories get any kind of play on the cover of the sports section at all.

Fine. We've spent the better part of two decades whining about this. Soccer speaks for itself. The market for the game is growing and will continue to expand for some time to come. AsÂ <a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/2010/03/some-thoughts-on-internet-and-football.html  " target="_blank">Richard Whittall</a> correctly observes:
<blockquote>And as large, ungainly media outlets are forced to cut costs and broaden content, in-depth sports journalism will be left to a sea of independent, often fan-biased bloggers working with their own resources. Many club supporters will be smarter, more connected, and more knowledgeable as information about club and league power structures are exposed to an increasingly-global fan base.</blockquote>
The vibrant and growing community of writers that has evolved online has been a great (if only partial) antidote. In some ways, this grassroots journalism resembles the punk rock and Jamaican music scenes of the '60s and '70s. If you don't find what you want, do it yourself. This attitude has served soccer well at a time when the internet enables anyone with the chutzpah to pretend to be an expert and the free time to devote to it to become a soccer pundit with hundreds, if not thousands of followers. The laptop and Wordpress are the three chords of the internet revolution. Anyone can do it, and when the "professionals" won't, anyone will.
<h2>The super subs</h2>
As I researched this piece, I kept finding (or being reminded of) more and more examples of very nice work being done by amateurs, bloggers and professionals alike.

There's The Run of Play, whose <a href="http://www.runofplay.com/2010/04/22/mourinho-guardiola/" target="_blank">ether binge cultural criticism</a> is nothing if not fascinating (not to mention its design, which is truly unique in this genre). There's the pseudonymous Fake Sigi (a Fake Steve Jobs aimed at those who follow one of Major League Soccer's most successful and rotund coaches, Sigi Schmid), whoseÂ <a href="http://www.fakesigi.com/2010/04/mls-web-site-disaster.html" target="_blank">scathing dissection and analysis</a> of the league-run mouthpiece, MLSsoccer.com, has been a real revelation in recent months.

Then there's the fan-oriented networks of bloggers and podcasters who spend countless hours watching, breaking down and reviewing matches. Many of them conduct interviews with players, coaches and officials as well as journalists and fellow fans.Â <a href="http://www.seeingredny.com/" target="_blank">Seeing Red</a>, a relatively new podcast covering the New York Red Bulls, has been a valuable addition this season to the coverage of the team from the fan's seats.

<em>(In the spirit of full disclosure, over the past six years, I have edited a pair of soccer blogs, on my own and for my former newspaper. Those experiences, and their unceremonious ends, give me even more respect for those who continue to slog away at the daily grind of blogging.)</em>

Add to these the traditional newspaper and magazine journalists who have taken to the web and social networks to hone their brand and solidify their command of the beat:Â <a href="http://www.soccerbyives.net/" target="_blank">Ives Galarcep</a>,Â <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/" target="_blank">Steve Goff</a>,Â <a href="http://twitter.com/grantwahl" target="_blank">Grant Wahl</a>,Â <a href="http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">Jack Bell</a> and so on.

There's a lot to like. Still, we can and should all expect a lot more.

Understandably, some bloggers and amateur reporters can adopt a defensive posture on the subject of professionalism. It's not unique to soccer writing, and it's certainly not unique to America. Although the issues are somewhat different in England,Â <a href="http://twitter.com/lukeymoore" target="_blank">Lukey Moore</a>, one of the fanatics behind the hilarious, exceptional and smartÂ <a href="http://www.thefootballramble.com/" target="_blank">Football Ramble</a> podcast, elucidated this viewÂ <a href="http://www.toepoke.net/post/2010/04/30/The-Football-Ramble.aspx" target="_blank">in a recent interview</a>:
<blockquote>There is a bit of a backlash in the media these days against things like amateur blogs and podcasts, a lot of journalists think that the general public's opinions are not as valid because they are not 'proper journalists'. Doesn't really bother me though, I can count on one hand the number of football journalists I actually respect.</blockquote>
There's no argument that professional caliber journalists don't hold a monopoly on opinions or incisive commentary. But in one important regard, they can't be beat. Few others have the time, patience or ability to build relationships with sources in the game that can unlock difficult stories. That kind of deep reporting can grant them the authority to ask the unpopular questions that the powers-that-be would rather ignore.
<h2>The need for game-changers</h2>
In my little free time, I want to read something about soccer in North America that: a) I didn't know already, b) casts a critical eye on the sport, and c) comes from someone who is a skeptical spectator, disinterested in the outcome of any particular game.

There are a few dozen solid reporters on the beat in this country, as the roster of theÂ <a href="http://www.soccerreporters.com/" target="_blank">North American Soccer Reporters</a> will attest. But there aren't nearly enough.

New York Times executive editor Bill Keller'sÂ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/books/review/Keller-t.html  " target="_blank">recent review </a>of a biography of Henry Luce captured a bit of my quandary.
<blockquote>...a significant population of serious people feel the need for someone with training, experience and standards â reporters and editors â to help them dig up and sort through the news, identify whatâs important and make sense of it. That in no way precludes enlisting the audience as commentators, as contributors and as collaborators. (Witness the splendid hybrid of professional and amateur journalism that has kept alive the stream of news from Iran.)</blockquote>
Some days, it seems that 99 percent of soccer "news" could be classified as either game transcripts or outright <a href="http://twitter.com/GrantWahl/status/13805381375" target="_blank">boosterism</a>. I read quite a bit of it, but I also want the news that you can really only get by chasing it full time, building relationships with players, front office staff, owners, league employees, coaches and referees over the years.

In the jargon of my industry, I want more of the old media's values in this new media sport: Accountability, speed, skepticism, fearless questioning of authority. Get it fast and get it right, and when you don't get it right, own up to your mistake and correct it. Without these kind of mores suffused into our writers, I worry that far too many important stories are crying out for more reporting. <a href="http://twitter.com/CdnSoccerBlog/status/13805459081" target="_blank">What happened to Charlie Davies</a> on the night of his accident? What is going on with <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/soccer/articles/2010/04/28/revolutions_joseph_in_substance_abuse_program/" target="_blank">Shalrie Joseph's life</a> and career? What kind of negotiations went into crafting Major League Soccer's latest labor agreement?

Sometimes it seems there's a disconnect between soccer writing and news journalism. I go to work every day and ask questions of people in power because I act as a proxy for the regular, taxpaying resident. There is a presumption that government should be open and accountable. Regardless of how much we couch it in terms of passion, culture and tradition, soccer is a business. It's becoming a very lucrative business, and it's very closely held. It's a private enterprise, and thus there isn't that same moral authority to ask questions and demand answers. But still, reporters should be using their access, knowledge and insight on behalf of the average fan.

Someone needs to ask probing questions. We need reporters to help hold managers and clubs responsible for their mistakes, whether they be poor tactical decisions at a US Open Cup match or the financial mismanagement of an entire club (See: Portsmouth, Leeds, Crystal Palace, Chester City, LA Sol, Miami Fusion, etc). We're being sold a product, whether it's season tickets or jerseys or television advertising. If we're going to invest our money (not to mention time and energy), it should be worth our investment.
<div><a href="http://comm.psu.edu/people/mch208" target="_blank">Marie Hardin</a>, a professor at Penn State's <a href="http://comm.psu.edu/about/centers/john-curley-center-for-sports-journalism" target="_blank">John Curley Center for Sports Journalism</a>,Â <a href="http://media.www.mediaethicsmagazine.com/media/storage/paper655/news/2007/12/31/AnalysesCommentary/Newsroom.Ethics.And.Sports.Journalists-3227706.shtml" target="_blank">wrote a piece</a> in 2007 arguing for a stronger ethical grounding for sports reporters:</div>
<blockquote>One has to wonder what other stories in the public interest (about systematic problems and corruption in sports, including those at the prep level) may have also gone unwritten. Although perceived as fun and games, sports at almost every level in the United States have become big business with consequences beyond the playing fields. Sports journalists have an ethical obligation to provide citizens and consumers with fair and balanced reporting on issues that affect their communities, their pocketbooks and the health and educations of their children.</blockquote>
Here in America, we need more reporters walking the soccer beat day in and day out, particularly in towns that aren't so sexy. We need more people in Kansas City, St. Louis, Salt Lake City and Dallas, for example. We need more people asking tough questions and competing with the writers already out there. A competitor breathing down your neck really helps you kick it into gear and get a better story.

Before we get more writers (which I'll discuss in a second part tomorrow), we need to add the values of professional journalism to the healthy and established internet community of writers. I'm not advocating for a new alliance of bloggers, each sitting in his own apartment and riffing, linking back and forth. I'm talking about a serious, concerted effort to groom, deploy and support soccer writers.

<em>Tomorrow, I'll discuss how the writers we have can get better and what we'll need to do to get more of them.</em>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A very good read, Tom. You mention many of the soccer sites on the internet that I frequent, and I often recommend to those whom appreciate thoughtful writing. 

Here in the Bay Area, we do not get much in the way of coverage from traditional outlets. The San Francisco Chronicle doesn't seem to realize that soccer exists. Elliott Almond at the San Jose Mercury News is really the only full-timer in the local newspaper business, and even he gets shuttled off to cover college sports on occasion. With an eye toward providing more independent coverage of soccer in this area, former internet soccer writer Jay Hipps started the website Center Line Soccer back in 2007, and invited Jeff Carlisle (a freelance writer known for his work at ESPN.com) to be a main writer. Others joined the crew including photographers and features writers. Carlisle has recently moved to ESPN.com full time, and now I have been elevated to his position at Center Line, helping to get the word out on the Quakes, FC Gold Pride, and other soccer news around the Bay.

My rewards do not come from a hefty paycheck in this endeavor, rather they follow from the acknowledgment of fans and followers of a job well done. I also welcome the comments and criticism of my readers for I certainly can not improve the quality of my work in a vacuum. Maybe, with time and practice, some of the better amateur journalists will be able to carve out careers covering soccer. However, until that future arrives, may those dedicated to sharing their passion for the game through local soccer coverage continue to flourish. I know these writers will always have my support.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the support, everyone. 

Juan, I was very lucky at my old paper that we had an editor who loved soccer and a very strong soccer reporter. For the last World Cup, we put it on the front page for weeks. I spent a good amount of time watching games in tiny social clubs with Argentines and Serbians and German-supporting Costa Ricans. Very rare to see, but it was a small daily (~30,000 circulation) that catered to working-class immigrants and first-generation Americans, many of whom love the sport.

Brian, thanks for letting me know about the local media attention in Houston. I've added your podcast to my playlist, so I'll check out your show.

Daniel, I have a lot of appreciation for bloggers. I think it's fantastic that people are willing to pitch in where they see a need for news to be covered. And yes, the growth of soccer (and the coverage of it) has been a very slow process and will continue to be for a long time to come, I think.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great article Tom.  I write a small soccer blog in Denver, called the Green Army.  I was surprised to see how little coverage soccer gets here in Denver when I moved out here from Southern California.  Like yourself, I'm a soccer nut. So I decided to do my part, even if it is a small one, in helping soccer get more visibility in the media. 

I'm happy to see you have some appreciation for us bloggers. I know we aren't all top notch journalists but at least we care enough to do something to make things better. 

Coverage has improved this year thanks to the efforts of MLSsoccer.com writer Nick Thomas, Brian Jennings at Soccer365, and the people at Channel 2 and the Denver post.  I think we are getting there, but its a slow process.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Really like the article.  I sympathize with you being a soccer nut that was stuck in Bristol, CT for four years and wrote for the community paper there.

Also was told by the editor of the Hartford Courant that no one would go to the USA-Argentina match at Giants Stadium because no one cares about 'that stuff'.   In reality, over 80,000 went and I through it back in his face. 

In essence, I would never get a call back from them. LOL.   :&gt;]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>Who's minding the goal?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[After <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2010/05/no-cheering-in-the-press-box/" target="_self">yesterday's discussion</a>, some might ask the obvious question: aren't there already people doing this?

I don't intend to denigrate the years of service by so many passionate and intelligent fans. I wish they could have been compensated even a fraction for the sweat they've poured into writing about the game.

And with varying degrees of success,Â some organizations are attempting what I propose, to support legions of writers with the values and resources of their ancestors in newsprint. There's a battalion, at least, ofÂ <a href="http://twitter.com/RichardFarley" target="_blank">podcasters</a>.Â There are networks of soccer scribes likeÂ <a href="http://american-soccer-news.com/" target="_blank">American-Soccer-News.com</a>. And thenÂ there'sÂ <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/" target="_blank">MLSsoccer.com</a>.

There has been a little debate about whether fans should consider MLSsoccer.com to be a legitimate and credible news outlet. Forget for a moment that no other major organizations provide comprehensive reporting on the domestic leagues (even though one would expect that <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team/_/team/660/united-states?cc=5901&amp;ver=us" target="_blank">ESPN</a> or <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/usa" target="_blank">Fox Soccer</a> would want to mount such an effort) and that MLS is simply stepping into the breach to give fans what they want. Â With the sweeping inhouse relaunch of the site this season, the league and its employeesÂ clearlyÂ plan to "cover" the sport, both here and abroad. But should they, and if not, what role should the league's official website play?
<table style="width: auto;" border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wWFilizI4g0/S-Fzl6N7_XI/AAAAAAAAN8A/x0ES6-uCGn8/s800/goal.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="341" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">Photo by <a href="http://fotonomad.net/" target="_blank">Diego Radzinschi</a><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tom.ginger.meagher/VFire?authkey=Gv1sRgCLHv_tuQ1JzmnwE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<!--more-->

We need to remind ourselves that MLSsoccer.com is the public relations arm of a major corporation.Â Many fans would agree that we really can't trust the site to give us honest, straightforward reportage on issues that are less than flattering to the league as a whole. As other writers (including <a href="http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/ussoccerplayers/2010/04/mlssoccers-competitive-balance.html" target="_blank">one at the U.S. Mens National Team Players Association's official website</a>) have observed, it's like watching a snake eat its own tail when you try to get information from an official mouthpiece that also attempts to cover the news.Â You don't rely on the Federal Reserve for unbiased, critical and important writing about U.S. monetary policy. You don't need to do it with your favorite sport either.

MLSsoccer.com ought to be a repository of fast, easy-to-find video and (I credit this concept entirely to <a href="http://soccer.fakesigi.com/2010/04/mls-website-panic-switch.html" target="_blank">FakeSigi</a>) openly accessible statistical data. The site should create a public API to allow fans to use the league's entire database of historical game and player statistics. One can imagine how a blog likeÂ <a href="http://usasoccer.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Climbing the Ladder</a>, which I believe does its analysis with its own cobbled-together data, could be even cooler if it had the actual league stats to tinker with.

Although MLSsoccer.com is keeping more than a few people gainfully employed, I want to see more organizations spring up so that so many writers aren't directly dependent on the league to make a living. We need to find ways to support good, young soccer writers so they can work, report and get better at their craft without having to shill for MLS.
<h2>Unravel the conflicting interests</h2>
Outside MLSsoccer.com, much of the writing on the U.S. game resembles the pamphleteering of the early Republic. Lots of Whigs and Federalists write blogs for like-minded folks, but their own biases can make them hard to take seriously.

Although some good coverage of the sport comes from partisans, I don't want the writer on whom I rely to be staked in the camp of any one team. There shouldn't be any fans in the press box. Stories and podcasts about games shouldn't include the word "we." Soccer fans are incredibly passionate, and they go to great lengths to identify with their teams. But I want knowledgeable, independent writers, free of the auspices of the league and its card-carrying supporters clubs.

To this end, I'd like to see American soccer writers, professional and amateur, adopt the ethical guidelines of the <a href="http://apsportseditors.org/" target="_blank">Associated Press Sports Editors</a>. As an organization, the <a href="http://www.soccerreporters.com/" target="_blank">North American Soccer Reporters</a> should publicly lean on its members, particularly those not affiliated with news agencies with their own ethics policies, to subscribe <a href="http://apsportseditors.org/apse-ethics-guidelines/" target="_blank">to this code</a>. It reads, in part:
<blockquote>Editors and reporters should avoid taking part in outside activities or employment that might create conflict of interest or even appearance of a conflict.
<ol>
	<li>They should not serve as an official scorer at baseball games.</li>
	<li>They should not write for team or league media guides or other team or league publications. This has the potential of compromising a reporterâs disinterested observations.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
As fans, we pay to support soccer in this country, whether in satellite packages or scarves. If for no other reason than we want to make sure that our money is well spent, we should expect the people who deliver the news to be minding the bank rather than boosting their club.Â The only hitch: we may have to pay more to get what we deserve.
<h2>No more free transfers</h2>
At the very least, we need more neutral, unaffiliated writers who embody the traditional values of newspaper journalism. In an ideal world, that would come with a major investment to create a news organization that could do justice to soccer's huge potential in this country.

So far, there have been a handful of single proprietors who have been successful at making a living on the internet as soccer hacks, most notably my former <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/" target="_blank">Herald News</a> colleague <a href="http://www.soccerbyives.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Ives Galarcep</a>. But I'm proposing an online publication that would require the footprint and resources of a larger organization to make it work.

There are <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/daed.2010.139.2.26" target="_blank">several--largely untested--business models</a> that, with the right editorial direction and an angel investor or two, could produce soccer news worth paying for. Not everything needs to be locked behind a pay wall. Until relatively recently, <a href="http://www.socceramerica.com/" target="_blank">Soccer America</a> did just that, a print-focused decision that could be argued largely blunted its influence as the demand for soccer news on the web exploded. I'm not advocating for any particular model, whether its based on subscriptions, syndication, micropayments or the like. But readers need to understand that you can really only get the stories you want when a publication can pay for the work it takes to dig them up.

Early in my career, I wrote about the Kansas City Wizards for Cyber Soccer Associates, a group that still exists and now maintains the <a href="http://american-soccer-news.com/" target="_blank">American Soccer News</a> site. For two seasons, I followed the team, writing game previews and match reports. I hesitate to say I "covered" the Wizards. As a part-time writer, I didn't have the time to attend training sessions, and I really had no idea what I was doing. I didn't develop stories or break news. I mostly reacted and transcribed game events. It was a great gig, but in retrospect I see the missed opportunities to go deeper. The model of American Soccer News, and I believe <a href="http://www.theoffside.com/" target="_blank">The Offside</a> as well, is to create a network of volunteer writers dedicated to individual teams and link them all under one banner. It's a great idea, but it falls short in a couple of key aspects: it's a part-time gig at best, and there's a tendency for the writers to be advocates for the teams rather than probing journalists.

This all leads me once more to a key question, as <a href="http://www.amoresplendidlife.com/2009/11/long-winded-post-on-future-of-soccer.html" target="_blank">Richard Whittall</a> has asked time and again:
<blockquote>Don't most soccer bloggers secretly consider a career writing for a major news organization with all its resources, access, accreditation and living-ish wages, the ultimate endgame for their online endeavours?

...Is this after all just a fun little hobby? And if not, what are we all going to do about it? Are traditional pay-for-content models really and truly dead?</blockquote>
The newspaper industry has largely ignored soccer, but the values of the daily print journalist are hard to beat. And the truly good newspaper reporter is impossible to replace for free. With all the writers slogging away at this subject, we have the raw talent. We have the knowledge. We have a market for the news. The soccer fan should be an advertiser's dream demographic. We need the business acumen that can monetize the news so that writers can make the jump from dedicated and sometimes gifted amateurs to professional reporters, with all the accountability and responsibility that entails.

There are two things on which American soccer fans can generally agree. We want thriving, world-class domestic leagues, for both men and women, and we want the men's national team to win the World Cup. At this point, we're decades, if not generations away from realizing those dreams. But we can get there by taking one step at a time, and the most important step is to keep the sport alive here long enough for it to happen.

A vigorous press, despite its shortcomings, has always been vital for a strong democracy. For soccer to continue to grow in America, we need a stronger, independent press. To do it right, to have professional reporters competing to break stories in every city with a team, it will cost money. For soccer fans and other interested readers, it may be end up being cheap, but it won't be free. At the end of the day, for the sport we all love, it will be a small price to pay.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Also, Tom, I'd disagree that The Offside falls short because the sites are written by fans. Full disclosure: I'm biased because I work for The Offside.

But the aim of a site like The Offside is precisely that: to provide a network of fan authored blogs,  not to provide unbiased professional journalism. 

So it's a little harsh to say that those sites fall short just because they're exactly what they're intended to be. It's like saying an apple falls short of being an orange.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Daryl, that's a perfectly legitimate goal for your site to have. I think there's room for a lot of coalitions of fans blogging on their teams. And in an ideal situation, as you say, such projects would complement varied and robust straight news operations. 

I mentioned The Offside in this essay because of its fairly high profile, and I'm not sure how many readers understand that its aim is to be a network of opinion blogs rather than to offer traditional news coverage. 

Your criticism is certainly fair. But I think an orange does fall short of the mark for the person hunting for an apple that's nowhere to be found.

Regardless, keep up the good work.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Obviously the ideal situation would be to have the professional mainstream press covering soccer in the same way (or at least with the same dedication) that it covers other sports. Blogs could exist alongside that quite comfortably, and benefit from it. But the US isn't there yet.

Hopefully the multitude of soccer blogs will encourage the growth of soccer coverage in the US, and eventually lead to the mainstream media giving soccer the sort of attention you describe in the final paragraph.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Excellent piece (and not just because it mentions ASN). Completely agree that "fans" should not be in the press box. Unfortunately that's all MLS can get to cover these teams in many instances! Also agree that a standard (no "we" talk) and style guide should be adhered to. Only problem with this is you need editors (and ideally copy editors as well). Which is more of a cost center.

I did some math a little while back and came up with this quasi business plan that you might find interesting:

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<div id="btop">"A good measure of an excellent reporter is whether  they are willing to take any story -- <strong>including the weather</strong> -- and make  it sing. After all, EVERYBODY reads weather stories â¦ and any reporter who  doesn't want to be read is just plain dingy." <em>- Former Herald News City Editor Jaci Smith </em></div></blockquote>
<div id="acontent">1. To every season, there is a weather event worth reporting:  fall is hurricane season; winter is northeasters, snowstorms and their big  brother, blizzards. Spring brings rains, floods, thunderstorms and tornadoes.  Summer heat waves and droughts. For many readers, weather is simply an  inconvenience, an add-on to commuting time, a day to figure out what to do with  the kids when schools close. For most, however, it is the single point of  contact people have with nature, often a demonstration and reminder of her  awesome power. This should not be forgotten when you write weather  stories.

2. What every weather story should contain: Accurate depiction  of the event, free of jargon. Technical terms explained for reader. Deaths and  injuries. Accidents, traffic and otherwise. Power outages. Property  damage.

3. <strong>Get the basic facts, then get out to the streets</strong>. It's  a fact of life that newspapers are not the first source people turn to in  weather situations. There are dozens of TV and Internet sources, not to mention  radio. There is no point in writing a boring and outdated laundry list of  traffic tie-ups and auto collisions. Instead, find a way to tell the weather  story that brings the meaning of the weather home and reports its impact on one  person or place, family, business, school or group. Zoom in. Find a novel angle,  find the drama, humor, irony in the day.That is where your inventiveness and  initiative come in. That's what readers will gobble up. It needn't be long. It  needs to be sharp, full of detail, clearly observed, brilliantly told.

4.  Graphic representation of the event. Decide early if <em>a propos</em>. Maybe graphic exists on wires.

5. Sources and web sites.

6. Find out as much in advance as you possibly  can if you are being assigned to the weather story. If you are, leave ample time  to drive or get places in bad conditions, dress appropriately, keep in touch.  And be careful out there.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sink your teeth into your beat and make it your  own.
<ul>
	<li><a href="/files/tips/mannydev.pdf" target="_new">Excellent tips from <em>El Nuevo Herald</em>'s Manny Garcia.</a></li>
	<li><a href="/files/tips/beatdev.doc">Columbia Journalism lecture on beat memos</a></li>
<li><a href="/files/tips/beatmapsop.doc">The <em>Herald News</em>' guide to assembling a beat map</a></li></ul>

Developing sources takes commitment  and a long-term strategy. You have to be deliberate and relentless. Here are  four ideas that will provide dividends in better and deeper stories:

1.  BEAT MAPS. A beat map is, in essence, a do-call list of non-governmental players  on the beat. In Paterson, for example, one might list clerics, business people,  academics, etc. The basic idea is to check in regularly with people in the know  in various fields, who can tip you on what's happening - much as cops cover a  beat. Former police Chief Lawrence Spagnola stresses how much information his officers obtained from the religious community and the PAL. A beat map is an  antidote to city hall-centered or meetings-heavy coverage.

2. HOLE CARDS.  These are sources you keep in the hole, as you keep some cards down in stud  poker. It's often useful to have sources in the community whom you talk to off  the record, and who trust you not to expose them in your stories. These could be  anyone from a former mayor to a tax assessor you develop a relationship with, to  a citizen who has lived in town all her life. These are your go-to folks. People  who tell you what's happening behind the scenes. People who explain the ins and  outs of an issue, the interests at work. People who tip you on a hot story.  People who talk frankly and help you piece out the story. People you talk to  regularly, but don't quote: your aces in the hole.

3. <a href="/best-practices/third/">THIRD PLACES</a>. This idea comes from <a href="http://www.pewcenter.org/" target="_new">Pew Center for Civic  Journalism</a>. Every community has 1st places (city hall, schools, department  of public works) and 2nd places (chamber of commerce, churches, taxpayers  association meetings). Third places are public spaces where conversations take  place. They can include diners, bars, lunch counters, barber shops, laundromats,  libraries, bookstore cafes, beauty salons, parks where people walk their dogs -  any place where a reporter can settle in and have a chat with real people. Find  the 3rd places on your beat, and you're in a position to develop new and more  diverse sources that will fill out your stories with new voices and help you  discern what's important to the citizens on your beat.

4. LISTENING  POSTS. Allied to the idea of 3rd places, listening posts are exercises in  developing more diverse sources. The essential of listening posts is listening  to public conversations. Don't whip out your notebook and start asking a lot of  closed-ended questions. Use some hours to let the community come to you. Get to  know people you wouldn't otherwise: jobless, hookers, cops, soccer moms,  swingers, newspaper readers! Use your ears to pick things up and create new  sources. Don't pretend to be anything other than a reporter, but let people know  you are there to learn, not exploit people for quotes.

-<em>Jonathan  Maslow</em>, Herald News, Oct. 2004

<hr /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More Maslow tips for developing sources</span>:
	<li>Think of every person you meet as a potential source.</li>
	<li>If you don't live on your beat, run your errands there.</li>
	<li>Counterbalance the official sources by befriending the people in low places.</li>
	<li>Talk to sources off-story</li>
	<li>Bend over backwards with new sources. Read quotes back to them.</li>
	<li>Walk your beat to meet people.</li>
	<li>Always ask: "Who else can I talk to about this?"</li>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Get out of the council chambers and find out  what real people on your beat are talking about.

Here are two tips on diversifying your sources and finding  bold, edgy and real stories. They are culled from The <a href="http://www.pewcenter.org/" target="_new">Pew Center's</a> report "<a href="http://www.pewcenter.org/doingcj/pubs/tcl/" target="_new">Tapping  Civic Life</a>" and from the <a href="http://www.freedomforum.org/" target="_new">Freedom Forum's</a> "<a href="/files/tips/bestpractices.pdf" target="_new">Best Practices for Newspaper Journalists</a>."

1) Listening  Posts. Reporters tend to focus their beat work on conventional or traditional  places, classically city hall or the municipal complex, police headquarters, the  fire station, schools, etc. This automatically limits the contacts and sources  you have to work with, especially on deadline.
Listening posts are places  where minority, immigrant, seniors and other nonofficial community members  gather informally to gab and learn what's going on. They are the diners, delis,  small groceries, churches, barber shops, daycare centers, basketball courts, ball fields, senior centers, etc. where folks hang out. If you want to deepen  your understanding of what's important to people, find these listening posts--  and listen! It's suggested that a reporter not barge into such a place and start  asking a lot of questions. Don't deceive anyone that you're not a reporter, but  visit at first to just engage people in conversation, find out what's on their  mind. There are numerous listening posts in our towns. It's just a matter of  finding them and spending the time.

2) Community Catalysts. Social  mapping by several newspapers show that journalists tend to focus their  attention on official sources and civic activists, who are semi-officials in the  sense of their participation and involvement in special interest issues.  Especially in minority and immigrant communities, there are almost unknown  leaders who never show their face at meetings, but function as communicators,  neighborhood mayors, spiritual leaders, healers, etc. These community catalysts  are a largely untapped source of news and stories. Spend some time locating them  and you will eventually have a new rainbow Rolodex of sources that will improve  the thoroughness of your beat coverage and bring new voices to the  paper.

<h2><a name="local"></a>Section I: Local campaigns &amp; NJ ELEC</h2>
So, you want to start writing kick-ass stories about all of the underhanded campaign fundraising you just know is happening in your towns?

Good, you're going to have to want it really, really badly. Because in order to write these stories, you're going to have to be willing to spend a considerable amount of time entering data from poorly-scrawled and rarely examined public documents. The very fact that these documents are open to the public and available through any computer with an internet connection, however, makes these invaluable. Most candidates also realize that very few of their constituents, much less journalists, know where or how to find these documents.

You're going to learn how.

The first thing to understand is that New Jersey's election laws require candidates, or anyone raising money in hopes of becoming a candidate for public office, to declare to the state where they get their money from and how they spend it.

Most of the background reading you'll need is contained on the Web site for the Election Law Enforcement Commission (ELEC). You can find it at: <a href="http://www.elec.state.nj.us/" target="_new">http://www.elec.state.nj.us/</a>. If you're having trouble sleeping at night, you could try reading the manual <a href="http://www.elec.state.nj.us/pdffiles/forms/compliance/man_cf.pdf" target="_new">ELEC compiles for candidates</a> on the requirements of the law.

Here's a quick and dirty summary. Candidates raising funds more than six months before an election must file with ELEC on the first quarterly filing date after they receive their first donation. The filing dates generally fall about the 15th of the months of January, April, July and October.

It usually takes a couple of weeks for all of the forms to be scanned and make their way to the internet. For local, municipal and county candidates, ELEC will simply post PDF scans of the actual report on its site. For state offices, you can at least search ELEC's database, making it a little easier. Once the PDFs for local candidates are there, however, you can print them off to review or enter into the campaign finance database.

You should also note that if candidates only begin to collect funds within six months of the election for which they are running, the first report they file will be the 29-day pre-election report. All candidates file this report, and then they then must file 11 days before an election and 20 days after.

If money remains in a candidate's warchest more than 20 days after an election, the candidate must either a) continue to report quarterly or b) roll that money into a committee for his or her reelection and begin reporting quarterly for that new campaign.

Essentially, this means candidates who raise too much money to spend it all in one campaign should generally be filing every three months between elections. This creates a huge paper trail for clever reporters to follow.

Before you're able to search the ELEC Web database successfully, you will need to get IT to install Java on your computer's Web browser. Call the Help desk at x4400 and ask them to get it done. Have your desk supervisor sign off on this for you with an e-mail. Without Java, you will be stuck.

Once you have Java installed, to start reading the reports, go to the ELEC Web site. On the right-hand column, you will see a section head entitled "Search". Under that, click on the link to "View reports". If you're interested in looking at reports for an elected official (rather than a party organization), click the link to "View a Candidate/Committee Report".

At this point, the easiest thing to do is to look at how many candidates you could potentially incorporate into your database. On the search screen, click on the drop-down menu for location. Scroll down to Passaic County (or Bergen County) and find the name of your municipality. Click the search button and this will return a list of all the candidates who have raised money for campaigns back to mid-1999.

One thing you have to realize about a lot of computer-assisted reporting is that you need to make some fairly arbitrary decisions about what data is relevant to you. Since the ELEC Web site only holds files back to 1999, you may wish to just use 2000-a nice round number--as the cut-off date for your database. If, however, your mayor or freeholders entered office in the late-1990s, you may want to include those earlier campaigns as well. You need to make that decision and explain it in any resulting stories. If you want to get reports pre-1999, you'll need to request them from ELEC under the <a href="/best-practices/opra/">Open Public Records Act</a>. Be forewarned, if you go too far back, this can get costly and time-consuming. For the right story, it may very well be worth it.

You also need to decide which elections you're most interested in looking at.

Now, you may have noticed that ELEC has what it advertises as a "Searchable Campaign Finance Database" on its site. That database, however, only applies to statewide races as I mentioned earlier. If, like me, you're interested in examining municipal campaign spending, you have to build your own database.

You can now start to print out the raw reports that you'll need to use to start to fill such a database with numbers. You'll want to organize your paper files a little bit to make the data entry easiest. Start by creating a section of your files for each year. Then, you'll create a single manilla file folder for each candidate for that year's election.

Search through the ELEC database for all the reports for that candidate for that year. For example, look for Jose Torres' 2006 mayoral campaign reports. Because the ELEC interface is a little buggy, you can only print the reports out one at a time. When you have them all done in hard copy, put them in the manilla folder for that candidate.  On the front of the folder, write out the dates for each report. As you enter them into the database, you can check it off as an easy way to track your data entry.

Once you print out the forms, the first one you'll look for is the D-1 report. This form acts to create and organize a campaign committee. This also designates the campaign's officers, whether they be chair, treasurer or other officials. These are important to note to see if patronage jobs go to campaign officials after a successful election.

The next thing you'll want to look at is all of the information from the R-1 forms. The R-1 form allows you to keep track of the overall finances of a campaign. Under New Jersey law, candidates are only required to disclose the identities of donors who give more than $300 in a campaign (until last year, that threshhold was $400). Many candidates collect thousands of dollars from people who only can afford to give in small increments. These people you'll never know. This is good because it allows you to focus on the heavy-hitter donors who control a lot of municipal business. You still, however, want to know how much a candidate is getting in little bits.

Note the date stamped on the front of the report. This indicates when ELEC received it from the candidate.

You're going to learn a lot more about the political players in your towns by looking through Schedule A of the R-1 report. You'll all of a sudden start to undersatnd the relationships between developers, real estate brokers and municipal governance. You'll understand how a developer got the ear of the mayor for some cockamamie scheme when you see how much he donated to the last campaign. This is where the real relationships are spelled out.

Now we change lanes from the fund-raising to the spending aspect of the campaigns. The rest of these R-1 forms, starting with 1(D), look at who the candidate is paying and why.

You also want to look at donors who gave too much to a candidate by looking at the Adjustment Schedule. The candidates are only allowed to accept $2,600 from any individual or business over the course of a campaign. Of course, some donors will "accidentally" give too much money. When they do, the candidate is obligated to return the amount over the limit. This is useful for seeing who is maxing out on their donation limits and how timely the candidate is about returning money.

The caveat to all of this that you have to understand not only the ever-changing <a href="http://www.elec.state.nj.us/forcandidates/elect_limits.htm" target="_new">contribution limits</a> that ELEC sets on poltiical donors, but you also have to look for the loopholes candidates use. Never assume that just because it looks like one company gave your candidate $30,000 that it is necessarily over the limits. Talk to the donor, and to the candidate to see how it was actually given. It may have been five individuals from the same partnership who gave personal checks, but the candidate's campaign treasurer reported it as one lump sum. Ask for an explanation, and make them give you copies of the checks to prove it. And understand that even if you uncover something really egregious, ELEC is notorious for its lax enforcement. The very, very few candidates that it does penalize for violating the election law are often fined tiny amounts, usually about six years after they won re-election anyway. Still, it wouldn't hurt for you to look and see if any of your politicians have been <a href="http://www.elec.state.nj.us/ELECReport/ComplaintsDecisions.aspx" target="_new">spanked</a> for being caught with a hand in the cookie jar.

Finally, you'll want to see what other candidates your candidate is donating to by examining Schedule 3(D). This is an indicator of which candidates are power brokers in regional politics and which ones are just begging for crumbs from the big boys.

This can get complicated pretty quickly, but for larger towns, it's definitely worth the (extensive) investment of time to database your campaign finances. This can help you suss out trends over time and add up running totals without flipping through dozens of reports. Consider using this <a href="datafiles/tipsheets/DONORTEMPLATE.mdb" target="_new">database template</a> to start tracking your candidates. It requires a basic knowledge of Microsoft Access. The research reporter will be happy to help you get started.

<h2><a name="feds"></a>Section II: Federal campaign fundraising</h2>
Adapted from notes taken at <a href="http://www.ire.org/" target="_new">IRE's</a> <a href="http://www.ire.org/training/campaignNY06.html" target="_new">Following the money trails</a> seminar on Jan. 21, 2006, run by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" target="_new">The New York Times</a>' Aron Pilhofer and Ron Nixon.

Aron has three pet peeves when it comes to campaign finances:
<ol>
	<li>The assumption that all politicians are greedy</li>
	<li>The assumption that all donations are evil</li>
	<li>The assumption that money equals corruption</li>
</ol>
That having been said, it is still very fruitful to understand who is giving money to politicians and why.

The way to cover campaign finances is to start early, convince your editors that it is important, and avoid being a stenographer. Lead the coverage, don't respond to soundbites.

Keep in mind that this is a complex topic. Money is flowing everywhere, and increasingly it's going from state parties to the federal party apparatus and back. There's a lot to keep track of. We need to understand this as much as we can, because our sources are more sophisticated than us, and they know it.

Things have changed a lot since 1988, when soft money came in vogue. Democrats innovated this loophole, and the Republicans mastered it. Soft money is money raised by party committees for "party-building purposes", or for activities not directly related to elections. The money was spent on issue ads and state parties.

Eventually, in later years, soft-money was disclosed to the FEC. Then "political non-profits" emerged.

The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 created this atmosphere. The act, known as McCain-Feingold by the media and wonks and called "BCRA" (pronounced Bick-ra), works as it was intended, but 527s were one of its unintended consequences. BCRA does not ban issue ads. It bans funding from corporate or union sources for issue ads. It indexes (and raises) contribution limits to inflation. It creates a new source of funding for state parties. "Levin funds" or "soft money lite" can be raised only from individuals, in $10,000 increments, by state county and local parties. Depending on state law, corporations can donate. The money cannot be transferred, and it must be used for very specific purposes. It also enacts criminal penalties for knowingly breaking the law.

Bundling, the legal grouping of donations by company, is allowed. To have somone else donate for you, and then reimbursing them, is illegal. When you see someone donating with a suspicious job title, call them to see how much they're donating. Bush has mastered the art of networking donors.

State parties were extremely dependent on federal soft money, because the states could use it more efficiently. Before Levin funds, there were no prohibitions on donors or amounts to giving soft money. State parties now all have federal committees. Levin funds were not really used in 2004. Through BCRA, state parties will be required to spend federal hard money, or Levin funds, on state party activities, such as voter registration.

The biggest new development in several years is the creation of the <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/527/" target="_new">527 organization</a>. These groups can take as much money as they want, don't have to disclose anything and can spend it however they like, all perfectly legally.
<h3>Political nonprofits</h3>
Political nonprofits:
<ul>
	<li>501c3 - charitable organization</li>
	<li>501c4 - lobbying and public education</li>
	<li>501c5 - union</li>
	<li>501c6 - business leagues, chambers of commerce</li>
	<li>527 groups</li>
</ul>
Political nonprofits can engage in some level of political activity. They can <strong>not</strong>, however, engage in express advocacy, which means sending out communications that say "Vote for or against Candidate X".

Nonprofits are all the rage these days.

501c committee types:
- front groups for unions and corporations
- membership groups such as the NRA or AFL-CIO
- Issue groups: MoveOn.org
- mobilization groups
- religious groups

How much do they spend on elections? <strong>A lot</strong>. 501cs can not make donations directly to a candidate. 527s can. If Congress reins in 527s, a lot of money will shift to 501cs, which will be bad for reporters. Organizations have a lot of different nonprofit statuses and, thus, a lot of different wallets.
The Sierra Club has 501c3, 501c4, a federal political action committee (PAC) and a 527.

501c3 allows a limited amount of lobbying, and it has to be mission-oriented. There is no "electioneering" activity and no "express advocacy". The primary public record for this group is the <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/news/features/990_myths.jsp" target="_new">IRS Form 990</a>.

501c4s, 501c5s and 501c6s

These groups have no limits on lobbying. They have some limits on "electioneering" activity (they can't spend corporat or union money within 30 to 60 days before an election). They are no permitted to perform any "express advocacy". The public records for these groups are the IRS Form 990 and the <a href="http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=choosefields" target="_new">lobbying disclosure forms</a> and the <a href="http://www.fec.gov" target="_new">FEC</a>.

<strong>527s</strong>

Pre-2000, 527s were not required to disclose spending; they had no limits on electioneering; they had no limits on funding sources; they had no limits on contribution amounts; they were only forbidden from "express advocacy" in federal campaigns.

Then a law was passed to reform 527s. After the year 2000, 527s were forced to have some disclosure to the IRS, primarily in the Form 990 and in 8871 and 8872 forms.

Post-BCRA, 527s were limited on the amount of funding they could receive from individual donors and had some limits on electioneering.

Today, under the new, new, new 527 laws (post-2002), the 527 must disclose assets over $50,000 electronically to the IRS, there was an exemption for state funding and they were not required to file 990s any longer.

527s are a product of a loophole and not themselves a loophole. It was caused by the way difference in the way the IRS and FEC define a political committee. It is tax-exempt as a political committee because of IRS regulations. The term 527 comes from the section of the tax code under which political committees and PACS are granted tax exempt status. It's an automatic status. You just have to declare the committee's existence by filing with the FEC. There is no approval necessary. The IRS defines political committee as any group meant to influence policy or policy makers. The FEC defines a political committee as meant to advocate for federal candidaes. State law defines a committee as meant for state candidates. 527 committees advocate for neither state nor federal candidates and thus slip through the loophole.

501c organizations have many advantages:

Their money is largely undisclosed. Their individual donors are anonymous. The disclosure that is required is delayed until after elections. There are few restrictions on money.

They also have disadvantages:

Political activity cannot be their "primary purpose". They must have an IRS-approved "exempt purpose". There are tax implications for large donors - a gift tax. IRS will audit and strip tax status of 501cs that abuse the system. You have to be approved to get 501c status.

PACs are regulated by the FEC. They are allowed to give money to candidates and to go engage in "express advocacy". 527s cannot engage in "express advocacy" but are not regulated by the FEC.

Donations to 527s are restricted to $2,000 per individual, per election.

527s have to file with the IRS on the federal election schedule - quarterly on even years and semi-annually on odd years.

Who has to file?

- Any political entity engaged in politically-related activity <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> required to file with their state or FEC, must file with the IRS.

- These groups do not have to be formal or incorporated. A bank account can be considered a 527.

Either they file with the IRS, or the money is income and they must pay taxes on it.

The IRS has an online database with 23,000 groups listed, but only 600 to date (Jan. 2006), are true 527s. The data is very dirty and the IRS does not clean it in any way. <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/" target="_new">The Center for Public Integrity</a> does have a <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/527/db.aspx?act=main" target="_new">527 database</a>. The 527 is often based in DC or Virginia. It has a lot of cash. If you think you find one, go to the state and look for a similarly-named committee or state PAC. Corporations <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> donating to 527s that are trying to elect state and local governments. 527s may begin to shift their efforts more toward voter turnout and state AG races.

Some other resources:

Look at your federal candidates' "Statements of economic interest" by visiting The Center for Public Integrity's <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/oi/report.aspx?aid=377" target="_new">Our Private Legislatures</a> site. The forms, however, are notorious for incompleteness. The Center also has a great site on <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/527/" target="_new">527s</a>.

For state campaign finance information, <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/" target="_new">Follow the Money</a> is a good resource. If you call the institute that runs it, they will help you with questions. Pilhofer, however, does not trust their special interest codes in their data.

TV stations maintain "ad buy reports" that are open to the public. You can go and view them to see which candidates are spending money in your market. Also, the <a href="http://www.tnsmi-cmag.com/" target="_new">Campaign Media Analysis Group</a> keeps records of advertising spending. They have a paid Web site, but you can call them to ask how much money has been spent in your area.

Another helpful Web site is the <a href="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/" target="_new">Green Papers</a>, although its author is, um, colorful.

A source: <a href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/about/staff_sabato.htm" target="_new">Larry Sabato</a> at the University of Virginia's <a href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/" target="_new">Center for Politics</a> has done a lot of work looking at "walking around" money or "get out the vote" money.

Also, look at the <a href="http://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/" target="_new">lobbyist disclosure forms</a>. They will tell you what bills each lobbyist is working on. You can run the number of the bill through <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/" target="_new">THOMAS</a> to see what bill it is.

<a href="http://www.taxpayer.net" target="_new">Taxpayer.net</a> has a pretty big axe to grind, but the Taxpayers for Common Sense do great work on tracking earmarks, or pork, in federal spending.

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com" target="_new">The Washington Post</a> maintains <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/" target="_new">a database</a> of every U.S. Congress vote since 1991.

<a href="http://vote-smart.org/index.htm" target="_new">Project Vote Smart</a> lines up legislator's votes with interest groups and issues to see where they match.
<h3>The FEC</h3>
The way to track federal campaign donations is through the <a href="http://www.fec.gov" target="_new">Federal Election Commission</a>. If you visit its website, it has all the forms that candidates must use to file. Read <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm1i.pdf" target="_new">the instructions</a> for Form 1, the statement of organization. Form 3 is the report of receipts and disbursements.

In the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/em/em.shtml" target="_new">enforcement matters</a> page, people can file complaints against candidates, and matters are shown under review. You can query results of closed complaints. The jewel of the site, however, is under <a href="http://www.fec.gov/disclosure.shtml" target="_new">Campaign Finance Reports and Data</a>. You can download and look at electioneering disclosure reports.

When you make an "electioneering communcation" you have to disclose the donors who gave money. If they spend more than $10,000, they have to file with the FEC within 24 hours. An "electioneering communication" is a broadcast that in anyway identifies a federal candidate 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election.

But there are several pitfalls to looking at FEC data online:
<ul>
	<li>The downloads are difficult.</li>
	<li>They don't have street addresses for donors.</li>
	<li>What you know people as publicly may not be how their names are listed.</li>
	<li>If you are going to use someone's name, check, double check and triple check it. Then call them and check with them.</li>
	<li>In regards to excess contributions: filings are frequently amended later with reimbursements, so make sure you check the amended filings.</li>
	<li>In regards to lobbyists, when a company lobbies on its own behalf in the house, and is a registered lobbyist, its totals include how much it spent on external lobbyists as well. Beware.</li>
	<li>Individuals donating at a group fundraiser will be listed in an organizational table with PACs.</li>
	<li>Donors can give to a PAC, and earmark the money for a single candidate. It appears to come from the PAC, but it is counted by the FEC as coming from the individual.</li>
	<li>The federal government recognizes an LLC as individuals, so a contribution as an LLC can go over the spending limit as long as its officers itemize their contributions.</li>
	<li>The people who never show up in documents are the fundraisers who organize parties and dinners, but don't themselves donate.</li>
</ul>
In thinking about stories to do on campaign finance, think "Who does it hurt and how does it hurt them?" An area ripe for reporting is the nexus between campaign contributions, transportation and contracts. Think about what stories you want to write. Don't go on a fishing expedition through data. Think of what are the big issues. How will reports illustrate behind the scenes machinations? Who are the winners? Who are the losers? Start with the issues and move to the data.

For good stories, show the <em>quid</em> and the <em>pro quo</em>. Show donations, the likely effect and the letter between the donor and the candidate. This is a year-round issue, not just during election cycles.

One way to look at contributions is to put them on a timeline and see what day or week they spike. Then find the reason why.

To get the data, go to <a href="http://www.fec.gov/" target="_new">FEC.gov</a>. Click on "Campaign Finance reports and data". Use the <a href="http://herndon2.sdrdc.com/dcdev/" target="_new">Electronic Filing Report Retrieval</a> system. Find and download the house or senate committee for the candidate you want. Every candidate committee has a unique ID number. Find the right ID number and track your candidate through year-end reports.

Derek Willis' blog <a href="http://thescoop.org/" target="_new">The Scoop</a> offers a number of scripts to help you <a href="http://github.com/dwillis/fec-utilities" target="_new">download FEC and amended filings.</a> Be sure to look for amended filings.

The file you download will be a .fec file. Change the name to .txt. It is actually a comma-delimited text file (make sure that you get "Format documentation for downloads" in a .zip file). The resulting text file can be imported into Excel (starting with the 4th row). It is one spreadsheet of all expenditures and contributions. You can filter the columns and copy them into separate worksheets to make it easier.

Note that these are not the official filings, so things can change. The official filings are at ftp.fec.gov in the detailed files, but try the tutorial first. The memo fields are a hazard. Beware if anything is in it. Do not aggregate it because it is likely amended.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read all the documentation you can get your hands on.</span>

For help at the FEC, call Bob Biersack, its public information officer, at (202) 694-1220, or e-mail him at bbiersack@fec.gov. He is a data junkie and very helpful.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever fallen in love with someone's voice while you're interviewing and wished everyone else could hear it?

The internet<a href="http://myheraldnews.com/" target="_new"></a> offers an opportunity to give a literal voice to our subjects. Using digital audio recorders and simple editing software, we can combine interviews, natural sound and voiceovers to produce downloadable content for the site.

A live interview with a victorious congressman on election night, apples tumbling into the grinder for apple cider or the excitement of waiting in line for days for a PlayStaion3 are all opportunities for audio recordings.

Recording can be done in the field or in the studio (an empty office in the newsroom).

Any story has the potential for audio content, although it usually is not clear until we are well into the interview. If we record audio as a normal practice of reporting, the workflow becomes natural and streamlined.
<h3>Glossary</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Podcast - term used for a sound recording that is exported as an mp3 file and made available for download from a Web site to be played by the end user's computer or mp3 player, such as an iPod.</li>
	<li>Digital Audio Recorder - Marantz PMD660 or Edirol R1 or Edirol R09 are the brands/models we use. They are all digital audio recorders that use a memory card instead of tape.</li>
	<li>Non-linear editing - using computer software (Audacity) to edit media instead of tape decks.</li>
	<li>Lavaliere microphone - small microphone that is clipped onto the clothing of the subject.</li>
	<li>Handheld interview microphone - held by interviewer to record the subject's0 voice or other audio source. ElectroVoice 635N/D-B is the model we use</li>
	<li>Stereo microphone - records audio to both the right and left channel.</li>
	<li>Headphones - allow us to hear what we are actually recording and block out other noise.</li>
	<li>XLR cable - industry standard, three-prong connecting cord for attaching microphones to audio equipment.</li>
	<li>Dual-mono connection - A cord that allows a mono microphone's signal to be recorded to both stereo tracks.</li>
	<li>Wind Screen - foam covering for the microphone element that protects it from noise created by air movement.</li>
	<li>Compression - Removing data from a digital file (audio, photo or video) using an algorithm that maintains the perceptible quality. This produces a smaller file that downloads from the Web site faster.</li>
	<li>SoundSlides - Computer software that is used to create Flash slideshows that contain photographs, title slides and audio for the Web site.</li>
	<li>Audio level - The strength or "loudness" of the audio signal. This can be seen and monitored on the audio level meter and with headphones. If the signal is too loud or "hot," the audio is unusable.</li>
</ul>
At the Herald News, we use digital audio recorders that record sound to digital media, instead of using traditional tape. This has two advantages. First, the audio is recorded digitally, which means it does not have to be converted from analog to digital for non-linear editing on the computer. Second, it can be transferred to the computer much faster than real time. Using traditional tape, one hour of recording would take one hour to transfer. With digital one hour of audio may take five minutes or less to transfer, depending on computer speed and USB connection.

We also use high quality microphones, either lavaliere or handheld mics, when recording audio. Since we use severe file compression on the clips for our Web site, it is critical for the source audio to be as high quality as possible. Techniques for actual field or studio recording can be learned in one-to-one sessions Dave will conduct with interested staff members.

Our end product for the Web site can be podcasts, SoundSlides slide shows or video. The digital audio files recorded in the field can be used for any or all of these.
<h3>Recording</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Check the batteries and carry a set of spares!</li>
	<li>Plug the microphone into the Mic-in jack or the Mono XLR connection</li>
	<li>Plug you headphones into the headphone jack and adjust the level to your standard</li>
	<li>Hold the microphone at a 90-degree angle to the subject's mouth, approximately two to four inches away and below.</li>
	<li>Push record to record, stop to stop and play to make sure you have recorded a good sounding clip. Periodically check your recordings during the interview to make sure all is going well.</li>
	<li>If you are at a press conference, you may be able to plug the recorder into the "press box," which allows you to record the signal from the podium microphone. They use the standard XLR connection (may be male or female).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Editing</h3>
The following is the basic workflow for the editing process in the  audio editing program <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_new">Audacity</a>.
<ul>
	<li>Connect the recorder to your computer using the proper USB cable.</li>
	<li>Transfer (drag and drop) your files to a new folder for the current project. You are responsible for saving and archiving your original audio files. The recorders are periodically reformatted and there is no other backup.</li>
	<li>iTunes can be used to listen to your recordings, catalog your clips and make notes on timecode for editing. You can add notes to your audio clips and create playlists for organizing interviews by subject.</li>
	<li>Open Audacity and save a new project in your project folder.</li>
	<li>Import your audio clips to a new track. (mono for the Marantz, stereo for the Edirol)</li>
	<li>Select the entire track and "Normalize"</li>
	<li>Edit audio by copying segments of your original interview and pasting each to a new track. Use the time shift tool to reorder your clips to produce the story.</li>
	<li>Use the envelope tool to create fades and adjust the levels of the individual clips. In extreme cases, use amplify to increase the level of audio clips that are too soft.</li>
	<li>Select all of the clips you are using and "export selection to WAV"</li>
	<li>Use iTunes to compress your final sound project file to an mp3 that can be published to the Web.</li>
</ul>
Here are some other great <a href="http://mindymcadams.com/tojou/2009/updated-tutorials-for-audacity-audio-editing/" target="_new">tutorials for reporters</a> on how to use Audacity to edit audio, by an instructor at the University of Florida.

<h2>12 Best Practices of Interviewing</h2>
1) <strong>Organization &amp; Preparation</strong>. The best interviewers are well prepared. Prep includes reading clips and relevant documents; talking to editors for angle, etc.; distilling your story idea into a coherent budget line; and working out questions and interview goals and tactics before calling or going to interview.

2) <strong>Asking Good Questions</strong>. Take time before an interview, whether on the phone or live, to decide such things as what questions, how many, what order. Start writing the article to help develop specific questions. Some interviews are purely informational. Many are five Ws and an H. Sometimes you are looking for a quote, other times an anecdote. Sometimes you are interviewing for fair comment, for balance or to fill out a story with another voice. Knowing the goal of the interview helps conduct an efficient interrogation. Anticipate the readers' questions: How come? How do you know that? I don't get it! What do you mean? So what? Be aware that the best interview material often comes from the first and last questions. A good interviewer is an expert questioner.

3) <strong>Establish good rapport</strong>. The first minute(s) of any interview are about establishing good relations with the subject and working out control. Always identify yourself immediately as a reporter, say what you are working on (even if that's not precisely what you are really working on!), and politely request a few minutes (40 minutes, an hour, if live) of the source's time. Chat the source up a bit, if appropriate, but don't wait too long to come to the point. Always maintain courtesy and respect. Present yourself as innocent, friendly, unafraid and curious. Make sure the source knows the groundrules: everything on the record unless reporter agrees to go off. Cede some control at the outset by using broad, open-ended questions: Tell me what happened? Can you fill me in on X?

4) If you want thoughtful answers and good quotes, <strong>give your subject time to think and respond</strong>. Don't pressure for fast answers. The best stuff often comes after an awkward silence.

5) <strong>Don't be afraid to plead ignorance or ask for help</strong>. You are not supposed to be an expert in everything, only in gathering information and recognizing news. Subjects often respond to a statement from the reporter, like, "Can you help me understand this? If you can't help me, who can?" Remember: If you don't understand, the reader won't understand. If you don't get it, ask for an explanation.

6) <strong>Be an active listener</strong>. In live interviews, that means maintaining eye contact and showing with facial expressions and body language you are paying intense attention. In telephone interviews, it means interjecting words of reinforcement: "Uh-huh." "OK." "I understand." "Really?" Restating what the subject has said shows you understand what s/he has said. "What I hear you saying is..." "In other words, you..." Reflecting shows the subject you are listening and helps develop the topic. "So you feel pretty bad (good, hopeful, skeptical) about that?" "I guess you were pretty angry (frustrated, delighted, dubious...) about that?" Summarizing at the end of a long answer shows you are listening and helps shape and measure the response. "As I understand it, you think (said, did)..." "The key idea as far as you are concerned is..." In many interviews, listening is equally important to asking questions.

7) <strong>A good interview is a conversation</strong>. Matching the tone and rhythm of the subject will help the subject open up to you. Go with the flow: if the subject takes a sharp turn, be prepared to go off your planned line of questioning and follow his/her new direction. Don't be afraid to challenge bad information or incomplete, imprecise, unforthcoming answers, but don't be argumentative.

8 ) <strong>Ask the tough questions in the second half</strong>. That gives the subject time to warm up, but gives you time to get some info and facts, in case the subject bails or locks up. Don't accept when the source suddenly wants to go off the record without a fight. Bluffing is ok for tough questions. For example, ask the mayor why he fired the whistle-blower, rather than if he did so. A good tactic, sometimes, is to ask the tough question several times in slightly different variations dispersed through the interview among less tough questions.

9) <strong>Handle the "no comment" viola</strong>: 1) In the case of public officials, say something like, "I feel bad about just putting a 'no comment' in the story, since readers will think you don't know something you should know or you are hiding something. I'd prefer to put your side of the story in. Look, I only have two options here. I can write a fair story that says you refused to cooperate or I can do a fair story that has your point of view. Either way, I'm doing the story. Now which do you want?" 2) In the case of nonpublic officials who are maybe frightened, say something like, "You don't have to worry. You are just one of several people I'm talking with. It's no big deal. You have every right to speak. It's the American way."

10) <strong>Handle the lie with patient confidence</strong>. Don't interrupt the liar. Let him or her finish. Let him or her furnish the rope for his/her own hanging. If you have the nerve, simply ask for more details. Then calmly go back and deconstruct the lie point by point, confronting the subject with the lie. You have now cornered the liar.

11) <strong>Fail-safe closers</strong>. Never say "This is my last question." As soon as you announce it, you'll think of three more. Instead, try these: "Want to add anything?" "Who else can I speak to about this?" "Can I call back if I have another question?" "Is there anything else the newspaper should look into?"

12) <strong>The most important 15 minutes are after the interview</strong>. If you are not in the office, go to someplace where you can be by yourself and go over your notes, filling out and filling in. If you are in the newsroom, go over your notes immediately and fill out partial quotes, anecdotes, sentences, etc. Humans lose 50 percent of accurate recall after one hour, 90 percent overnight.

<hr />
<h2>Asking the Extra Question</h2>
Here's a familiar scenario: you go out to report a daily. Let's say a public housing authority is taking tenants from a building and moving them to other buildings. You ask the responsible official why. The official tells you that tenants no longer want to live in the building because it's dangerous and decrepit. The people are voting with their feet, the official tells you.

The housing authority, the official continues, is diligently finding
alternative accommodations for all the tenants. No one is being put out on the street. In addition, the authority hopes to get federal funds to tear
down the building, so that a private developer can build new housing. The authority plans to give the tenants of the bad building Section 8 rental vouchers so they can live in the new housing or find apartments in the private rental market.

Several tenants you interview confirm what the official has told you: they
don't want to live in the bad building; the authority is helping them
relocate.

You've got your story. Right? Not necessarily.

Here is where it's a good practice to ask the extra question: why? Why is the bad building bad? How did it get bad?

Logically, a building goes bad because it has poor security and maintenance. Why? Did the authority have the funds to secure and maintain? If not, why not?

Is the deeper story here that the feds have been withdrawing support for public housing and shifting support to Section 8? That's information that readers can use.

As you can see, asking the extra question(s) deepens the reader's
understanding, but requires the reporter to analyze what she has found and think about the story.

</a></li>
</ul>
These notes were compiled from discussions with The Record's Passaic County bureau editor Claude Deltieure. He is incredibly knowledgeable about local and school budgets in New Jersey and has been very generous with his time.

<hr />Budgets are made up of two main sections, revenues (income) and appropriations (spending). In an ideal world, these two would match up.
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Revenues</strong>
Property taxes
State &amp; Federal aid (fluctuates and may not come)
Miscellaneous revenues (fees, licenses, court costs)
Surplus (carried over from last year)</td>
<td><strong>Appropriations</strong>
Current expenses (salaries and other expenses)
Capital outlay (big ticket repairs)
Debt service (payment on municipal loans)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
As Claude is fond of saying, municipal financing New Jersey is "built for idiots." You have to "appropriate" the public dollar to use it for a specific purpose. The governing body must vote to do this to pay any and all bills. Capital outlay is defined as durable goods that last more than three years.

Your job, as a reporter, is to give readers an idea of how their taxes are going to go up and explain why.

The total property tax bill is made up of several components:
municipal services
schools
county
open space tax
regional district tax
fire
garbage
<a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/losap/losap.shtml" target="_new">Length of service annuity program</a>

The Length of Service annuity is meant to help support volunteer firefighters and ambulance corps. Each town will pay for a volunteer's equipment, and this money must cover that. One-penny on the tax rate goes to the annuities to be paid to a volunteer upon retirement.

New Jersey also ran out of landfill space 20 years ago, so it must pay astronomical amounts to handle its garbage.

Regional districts are shared and provide rural schools that cover several towns. The towns that "send" their students to school in another town must pay for those services.

You have to tell your readers that the municipal services tax is going up, not just that taxes as a whole are rising.

The state overseer of all issues regarding local finance is the <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/" target="_new">Division of Local Government Services</a> under the <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/" target="_new">Department of Community Affairs</a>. In many ways, it functions like a state version of the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/" target="_new">GAO</a>.

The LGS reviews every municipal budget and must approve it.

The council does not "pass" a budget. It first "introduces" it to the town's residents. Once the council introduces a budget, you as a reporter must be allowed to get a copy. They cannot give you a summary version. The council will then go on to "adopt" the budget. A governing body in New Jersey must have a two-thirds majority to pass a spending matter.

<strong>The impact in dollars and sense</strong>

The amount of your property taxes is based on the value of one-penny per $100 of the taxable value of your property. Each town hires an independent assessment firm every few years to perform a "revaluation" of its properties. On that, it bases its property tax assessments.

The tax rate is based on how much money your town collected last year. If you only collected 95 percent of the taxes last year, you can collect 105 percent this year.

That extra 5 percent, if you can collect it, is set aside as a "reserve for uncollected taxes". If this year you collect 98 percent of your taxes, that extra 2 percent goes into your surplus and reserve. The reserve is anything you didn't spend last year.

The surplus in the current budget comes out of last year's reserve. Towns will often underestimate their expected tax collection rate, or overestimate their appropriations so that at the end of the fiscal year, they will have money left over to build their surplus. A surplus should be between 3 and 5 percent of the total budget. You need to be able to communicate to your readers this pull-and-tug of making the revenues and appropriations match up.

You need to know how many tax dollars come into your town if you collect one penny per $100 of assessed valuation.

First, call your town's tax assessor and ask for the total valuation of your town. You can also find it on the LGS' Web site <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/taxes/taxmenu.shtml" target="_new">here</a>. If the total value of your town is $3 billion, one tax point will raise $300,000. So for every $300,000 in spending the city plans, it will levy one point in taxes.

To apply that to the average reader, multiply the tax-point times the average assessed value of a property in your town. Again, you can find this out from your tax assessor (who really should become your best friend), or from the LGS.

So if the average property in your town is worth $100,000, and your council wants to buy a $1.2 million jet for the mayor, how much will that cost your average taxpayer?

To find the average tax rate for each person: Divide $100,000 by $100 and then by 100 pennies. That gives you $10. So for each tax point that the town raises its taxes, the average homeowner will pay $10 more. If the municipality pays for the entire $1.2 million jet, that will cost 4 tax points ($1.2 million divided by $300,000 per tax point). That will cost your average taxpayer $40 more each year (4 tax points times $10 per point for the average home).

Figuring this out can help you paint spending decisions in a way readers can grasp. You should have these base figures--the total valuation, the tax point and the average value of a home--handy for each of your towns.

School districts also receive state aid based on a formula. The state expects each district to pay $10,000 each year to educate each student. The state looks at the average income and property values of each town to see how much it can afford of that $10,000 per student. If it doesn't have the money, the state will pay for the essentials. But arts and other programs, such as music, can not receive this "state equalization aid" from Trenton.

These budgets can be very confusing, but as a reporter, you need to learn as much as you can about how they work. You must be able to talk shop with elected officials about the budgets to be able to detect attempts at slipping items through without the public's notice.

<hr /><strong>By Tom</strong>
When we're writing budget stories, local officials often omit key numbers that every reader wants to know. To help ensure that you don't forget to press them to fill in the blanks, here's a handy checklist of the key figures you need to ask for. Every budget story must include this graf:
<blockquote><em>Under the adopted (proposed) 2010 budget, the owner of a home assessed at the borough average of $65,000 will pay $2,395 in municipal (school/county) taxes, a rise of $99.70 from last year or 4.4 percent.</em></blockquote>
Remember:
1. The fiscal year
2. The average home assessment
3. The total amount of that average municipal/school/county tax bill
4. The total dollar increase in the average tax bill
5. The percent increase in the average tax bill]]></content:encoded>

<title>The Census</title>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/files/tips/factfinder.pdf" target="_new">Intro. to Factfinder</a> from IRE</li>
</ul>
<hr />

The Census should be your first stop when looking for any kind of numbers to flesh out your stories. As a journalist, you should endeavor to use <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html" target="_new">Census</a> and <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/" target="_new">American Community Survey</a> data in your reporting whenever you can, to give context and detail to your stories.

The decennial Census is conducted every 10 years, as required under the U.S. Constitution. Workers fan out across the country to collect information about residents. Ideally, everyone in the country receives at least the short form Census. A smaller sample answers the questions of a longer survey that collects more detailed economic and social information. The numbers collected by the Census are integral in setting the populations that affect everything from Congressional district boundaries to federal housing subsidies and the amount of money spent on AIDS prevention programs.

Since the numbers are so important, and so much can change in a community in the 10 years between Censuses, the government launched a plan to begin updating the population and demographic estimates every year. Beginning in the 1990s, the U.S. Census bureau began testing the American Community Survey. In 2005, the most ambitious ACS was conducted. It surveyed 3 million households in the United States and Puerto Rico to provide a snapshot estimate of the state of the country.

The ACS provides data in dozens of categories for the nation, states, metropolitan areas and towns with populations as low as 60,000. It does not provide hard and fast numbers, but rather a ball-park estimate and should be treated as such. Because of this, the funding levels for so many federal programs are still based on the decennial Census, but we now are able to get a better sense of demographic changes year-to-year.

With the advent of the Internet, much of the power of the Census is now quickly available online. If you just want to find a very basic profile of your town, there are a couple of places to start. First, visit the Census's official website at <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/" target="_new">http://factfinder.census.gov/</a>. Click on the menu bar on the left column that says "fact sheet". This will give you a quick table on any town in the country.

If you want something a little more detailed that can help you compare different areas, visit <a href="http://www.dataplace.org" target="_new">Dataplace.org</a>, a service run by the Fannie Mae Foundation. This is also great for a basic profile, and they have tutorials to <a href="http://www.dataplace.org/help" target="_blank">help you get started</a>.

Another fun site, <a href="http://www.socialexplorer.com" target="_new">Social Explorer</a> will visually represent Census data on an interactive map for you. This can help you understand different statistics for the neighborhoods in your town and how they compare to surrounding areas.

All of these sites will unearth a wealth of information if you take the time to nose around in them.

If you want to take your reporting deeper and get more specific data, you should learn to work with the custom <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DatasetMainPageServlet?_program=DEC&amp;_submenuId=datasets_1&amp;_lang=en" target="_new">datasets</a> available on the Census' Web site. First click on the survey you want to explore on the left column underneath the "Data Sets" header. For example, you can choose "American Community Survey". Then, in the gray box that comes up, click on "Custom table" under "2005 American Community Survey".

Now you will be taken to a very easy interface that allows you to view statistics from any number of geographic areas. It's fairly self-explanatory. Just follow it step by step, adding data elements. When the site displays the table of the data you want, you can easily download it as an Excel spreadsheet to save for reference or analyze further.

Some Census-based story ideas (from our friends at <a href="http://www.ire.org/" target="_new">IRE</a>):
<ul>
	<li>Quantify an issue using Census data - people complain that all the renters in their town are abusing city services. Look at the Census to see the percentage of households that are renters. Is it really that high?</li>
	<li>Comparisons - use the data to show how one town stacks up against another. If neighboring towns have similar problems, can we show how their populations differ and if that will impact possible solutions?</li>
	<li>Crime numbers - Take the Uniform Crime Reports data and compare it to the Census population totals to determine a town's crime rate.</li>
	<li>Disasters - When calamity strikes, be able to very quickly put your fingers on information about what kind of population lives in the affected area and what it's needs might be (is it rich, poor, white, black, young, old?)</li>
	<li>Inequity between communities - When federal funding numbers are announced, check to see what kind of communities are receiving money. How does the population demographics compare to the funding amounts?</li>
</ul>

To keep up to date on all the latest Census information, you can check out the bureauâs press releases: <a href="http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/index.html" target="_new">http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/index.html</a>

You can also subscribe to the releases via an e-mail newsletter or RSS feed. Itâs definitely worth it to do so.

The way to keep your politicians honest, or even better to prove when they're being dishonest, is to have the right paper (and electronic) documents. As you approach your beat, and learn it inside and out, try to compile as many of these documents and statistics as you can. Keep them on hand. They will prove to be immensely useful countless times in the future.
<ul>1. <strong>Personnel list and payrolls</strong> - You need to get this in an electronic file. I don't care if they tell you they only keep it in cuneiform. Make them show it to you. Ask them to see the screen. Ask for the column headings. OPRA it, and OPRA it again. You need this in an electronic form, preferably in an "ASCII text, delimited file, burned to a CD". Any software should be able to save this to a text file relatively easily. Paterson and Passaic County, N.J. do this at a cost of $10 for the disc. Browbeat your town with that and make them do it too. You need from their personnel list, each and every employee's first and last names, city of residence, date of hire, title, department, salary, overtime and total compensation. Get this every six months. You can and will use it again and again.

2. <strong>Property list</strong> - You get this from your town's tax assessor's office. Pretty much everything in the rant for #1 applies here. This is a vital resource in covering a beat. Get it in an electronic format. Make sure you ask in your OPRA request for the list of every and all properties in the town, including the property's address, block and lot number, owner's name, owner's address, size, zoning classification, assessed value of the land, assessed value of improvements and total assessed value.

3. <strong>Vendor lists</strong> - This is another great thing to have. It shows every person who did business with the city (or got paid or reimbursed in anyway). You want to get this list for each of the last five years. It should have the city-issued vendor number, vendor name, and address; and the voucher number, check number, amount and date of each payment that vendor received.

4. <strong>Campaign contributions</strong> - How do you know who the power players (and the wannabes) are in your town if you don't know who's giving money to the elected officials? You want to spend a good amount of time familiarizing yourself with the <a href="http://www.elec.state.nj.us/" target="_new">NJ Election Law Enforcement Commission's</a> website, ELEC. Once you get used to reading the PDF files of the paper reports, then you can start to database them and really dig into it.

5. <strong>Lists of boards and committees</strong> - This is something the town ought to have. You need to know the names of all of the appointed and elected officials on every board in town. If the town doesn't keep this list, then you need to make it. Learn their names and phone numbers and call them.

6. <strong>List of car and cell phone assignments</strong> - Every town keeps a list of its cars and cell phones (if it doesn't, that's a good story). Get this with an OPRA request and see who has a car or a phone and how they use them.

7. <strong>Internal phone directories</strong> - You don't want the phone directory that the city publicizes for residents. You have to plead and cajole the city to get the listing for every extension in town. The clerk or main phone operator often has this. Beg for them for a copy.

8. <strong>Tax delinquents</strong> - At least once a year, the tax collector compiles a list of all the unpaid taxes in town. Ask her to give you the names (and amounts owed) of the 10 or 20 biggest delinquents.

9. <strong>Financial disclosure reports</strong> - Every April 30, every elected official and department head in the state must file a <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dca/lgs/ethics/ethcmenu.shtml" target="_new">financial disclosure form</a> with the state's Department of Community Affairs' Local Government Services division. Generally the municipal clerk will handle the collection of the forms to forward to the state. These contain information about properties owned, other employment, spouses and business interests.

10. <strong>Demographics</strong> - You need to know the basic demographic profile of your towns. For more in-depth statistics, visit the U.S. Census' <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/home/saff/main.html?_lang=en" target="_new">American Factfinder</a> or Fannie Mae's <a href="http://www.dataplace.org/" target="_new">Dataplace</a>.

11. <strong>Budgets</strong> - Try your best to get this in the electronic format in which the towns fill this out. If you can't, at least get copies of the adopted budgets for the last five years. Familiarize yourself with what your town is spending money on and how expenses change over time.

12. <strong>Brownfields list</strong> - The state's Department of Environmental Protection maintains lists of all the polluted brownfields sites statewide. This list will help you figure out what companies left a mess behind and what lots local leaders might try to hawk to developers at a cut rate. You can find the lists at the DEP for <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dep/srp/kcs-nj/passaic/" target="_new">Passaic County</a> and <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dep/srp/kcs-nj/bergen/" target="_new">Bergen County</a>.

13. <strong>Tax-exempt organizations</strong> - By looking at the IRS's "<a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/charitablestats/article/0,,id=97186,00.html" target="_new">Master File</a>" of tax-exempt groups, you can see what organizations have legitimate 501C-3 charity status. If you have a group calling itself non-profit in your community, it should probably be on this list (unless it's brand new and still getting it's paperwork filed). This list also includes great data on how much money charities are raising. It will point you toward which groups file <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/" target="_new">990 tax forms</a> that you can look to for more information.

14. <strong>Audits</strong> - Every year, your town must have its financial records audited by an outside agency. Get a copy of the volumnious reports the auditor files.

15. <strong>Requests For Proposals</strong> - Any time a city wants to spend a lot of money or something, buy something or put land up for development, it issues an RFP. Then a group of potential bidders, contractors or developers will submit their proposals in response to the city's needs. You want to go through the RFPs your town issues each years. This is usually handled by different people depending on the city agency who wants the work done. You can OPRA a list of the RFPs from the custodian of records. For ones that catch your eye, OPRA the actual RFP, the list of those who picked up a copy from the city, any addenda and each and every response.

16. <strong>Biggest employers</strong> - The county's office of economic development keeps a list of the top hundred employers in the county. Your town should also have such a list. Look for correlations between the big employers and the big campaign donors.

17. <strong>Crime data</strong> - Visit the <a href="http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/" target="_new">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> site to look for the crime stats for your town. Every jurisdiction in the country is required to file a Uniform Crime Report each year to the state and federal governments. The problem with the data is that it is self-reported. So police departments could distort their crime problem by mis-reporting it. Still, it's one of the best sources you have for this information.

18. <strong>Voting records</strong> - The county's <a href="http://www.passaiccountynj.org/Departments/window-elections.htm" target="_new">Superintendent of Elections</a> can give you much of what you need. You want to get the number of registered voters, by party and by district, ward or polling place. Then you want to get the election results by district, ward or polling place for the last five elections. You can compare these registrations and results to the demographics of those neighborhoods where the polling places are. Finally, get the addresses of each of the polling places in your town. Your municipal clerk may also have this information.

19. <strong>Lawsuits</strong> - You need to know the nature and status of all lawsuits in which your towns are involved. Start by first looking for federal suits at <a href="https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl?court_id=00idx" target="_new">PACER</a>. Search all suits, and in the party name enter "City of Paterson" or whatever town you cover. Then go to the <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/passaic/index.htm" target="_new">Superior Court</a> and look for state cases.

20. <strong>Lawyers</strong> - Compile a list of all the lawyers who work for and with your towns. Also keep track of other major lawyers in the area. The <a href="http://www.passaicbar.org/pcba_membership_directory.html" target="_new">County Bar Association</a> is a good place to start.

21. <strong>Annual reports</strong> - Many towns file annual reports. This may be done by individual agencies and submitted to the city manager, or it may be condensed in a State of the City address given by the mayor. Find out how your town keeps these reports and get copies of them.

22. <strong>Purchasing rules</strong> - Start by going to the purchasing agent and finding out how your city puts contracts up for bid. There is a statuatory threshhold below which a town may give contracts without having to put it up to public bidding. Ask your town how it does it.

23. <strong>Grants</strong> - This is often summarized in the city budget as state or federal revenue. Your city must apply for each and every one of these grants before receiving them. OPRA the grant applications. They are chock full of background information that can prove useful.

24. <strong>Capital Improvements</strong> - What projects are your city spending a lot of money on? Keep an eye on these.

25. <strong>Master plan</strong> - This plan will govern zoning and development in your municipalities. Get a copy and check to see that the development that's actually happening is following this plan.

26. <strong>Federal programs</strong> - What federal agencies are spending money on programs in your town? A visit to the <a href="http://www.gao.gov" target="_new">Government Accountability Office</a>'s Web site at www.gao.gov can help you find who's spending money locally.

27. <strong>OPRA</strong> - Learn what documents the <a href="/best-practices/opra/">Open Public Records Act</a> allows you to get, and use it.

28. <strong>OPMA</strong> - Similarly, learn how the state's <a href="http://www.njstatelib.org/LDB/Library_Law/lwopnmtg.php" target="_new">Open Public Meetings Act</a> works and how you can ensure access to public meetings. This can help you know when your town is breaking the law by closing meetings.

29. <strong>Reporter's privilege</strong> - The <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/cgi-bin/privilege/contents.cgi?st=NJ&amp;t=frame" target="_new">reporter's privilege</a> protects you from having to disclose information you've learned in the course of your news gathering.

30. <strong>Lobbyist data</strong> - ELEC also compiles required <a href="http://www.elec.state.nj.us/publicinformation/gaa_quarterly.htm" target="_new">lobbyist disclosure</a> reports. See what firms that work with your city are lobbying in New Jersey and what issues they're spending money on.</ul>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="/files/tips/act.pdf" target="_new">Open Public Records Act</a> is New Jersey's version of the federal Freedom of Information Act. This requires government agencies to make their records that are considered public available to anyone who asks. This law is an essential tool in getting the written documentation of our government's work.
Here's some tips on what to ask for, who to ask and how to argue until you get it.
<ul>1. You must request something that is a document the government agency holds, whether it be printed out on paper or in a fax or e-mail. You can't OPRA information (ie - "Tell me how many cop cars you have"), so you have to figure out what document will have the information you need ("I request a copy of the city's inventory of motor vehicles and to whom each is assigned.") You also must request the document in the medium in which it is kept. Some pre-reporting will help you immensely in this regard. You can find out if they have what you want in an Excel spreadsheet, or if its only written out by hand on a legal pad.

2. Understand that there are <a href="http://www.njslom.org/pubrecords_exceptions.html" target="_new">exceptions</a> to the law. Know what they are and how to get around them.

3. Figure out what agency will have the document you're looking for. Would it be the business administrator's office, the department of public works or the state department of community affairs? Ask questions and track it down.

4. File an OPRA form with the appropriate Custodian of Record. In most towns, the municipal clerk is the custodian. Under the law, you are not required to use the town's own OPRA form, but sometimes, however, it is just easier to use the town's.

5. Try to be as specific as you can be without being too narrow. Know what language the agency uses in compiling things. Ask for any and all similar documents. (ie - "I request any and all documents pertaining to the city's public works incident reports for the week of Sept. 8") Whenever possible, ask for the document in an electronic format. Things like payrolls and budgets are most useful when we can analyze them in the computer. Make sure you ask for these kind of items in an "ASCII text, delimited file in an electronic format, burned to a CD".

6. Keep track of everything you write and every interaction you have with the agency. Here is a sample <a href="/files/tips/opratrack.xls">tracking spreadsheet</a> you can use. Make sure to keep note of the dates and substance of each conversation you have with the custodian after the request is filed. If you think that the town may put up a fight over your request, give the legal department a quick e-mail to alert them.

7. The clock is ticking. Under the law, the records you request must be made available to you within 7 business days. In theory, this means that they have no more than 7 days to get you what you want. In practice, it means that towns often take 7 days to get you the records, regardless of how long it took them to find it. Some files, such as budget information, bills, payment vouchers, contracts and employee salary and overtime should be available immediately for inspection.

8. Prepare yourself for rejection. The OPRA law was only passed in 2002 and many clerks don't understand it. Until you have your custodian trained, he or she will likely balk at your request. Be prepared to answer their excuses. Jennifer LaFleur of the Dallas Morning News offers <a href="/files/tips/T1351.pdf" target="_new">a great tipsheet</a> (pages 4-7) to help you successfully argue for information and data. Poynter also prepared a <a href="http://poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=5429" target="_new">very nice list of excuses</a> to deny FOIA requests and how to answer them.

9. Don't back down. Argue for the information that you have every right to under the law.

10. The town may try to charge you an unreasonable amount to file your request. Don't buy it. They can only charge you for the cost of the copy (the paper or the CD), not for the labor involved in compiling it. If they try to slap you with a huge bill, call your lawyers (see #11).

11. If the town denies your request, in whole or in part, make them give it to you in writing. This is essential o appeal it. Take the rejection to your editor to ask for advice on how to follow-up. Then take the original OPRA request, a summary of your interaction with the custodian, and the rejection letter to your company's attorney.<strong></strong>

12. Win or lose, file another OPRA request, and then another. Always have two or three OPRAs in the pipeline in order to get your town's custodians in the habit of filling the requests. You should also be using OPRA to build up the <a href="/best-practices/docs/">reference material you need</a> to be on top of your beat. Put in an OPRA before you need it and expect to take several weeks to get what you want.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Story tips short and long</h2>
1.Write tight. Maybe the most important thing you can do to increase your productivity without doing more work is to write tight and trim your own work. Write briefs instead of 8 inchers. Write 8 inchers instead of 10 inchers. Write 10-12s instead of 12-15s. Write 12-15s instead of 15-18s. The tighter you write, the less time it takes and the more time you free up for other stuff. Time is a gift to the news reporter. Use that extra hour or half hour to stop in on your beat, talk to a couple sources on the phone, read online what other newspapers are doing, or skim-read documents or reports.

2. Prewrite/outline. Whether you sweat over your copy or it flows from your fingers like hot fudge, prewriting saves you time and energy. Take five to 10 minutes before you start to think how am I going to handle my story. Look at your notes and materials. Make yourself a thumbnail outline. What's your lede? What's your best quote(s)? What's the news important to readers? What's the background? What's the context? Once you've got a bijou outline, you've got a roadmap. Drive, she said.

3. Demand coaching. Editors know they need to story conference and coach writing and help with resources and ideas, but things get hectic and sometimes they don't. That does not mean you should not ask advice and coaching. The crucial times to talk to an editor are: before you start reporting; after you finish reporting, but before you start writing; when you've got a top; and, of course, when you have to make a late decision on whether the story holds up, reaching an alternate source, etc.

4.Master the art of the weekbook. It can't be said too often or emphasized too much: the weekbook is the key to excellent and efficient performance. At its basic level, the weekbook is a scheduling device. To take your weekbook to a higher level of value requires the additional ingredient: forethought. Here are several specific practices that can improve your weekbook - as well as your editors' esteem and your job satisfaction:
<ul>
	<li>Build a good mix of stories every week. No one wants to do the same thing day after day. Build concise dailies around news events, meetings, issues. Build in patches (centerpieces) by thinking what will make a good photo story. Build a weekend story every week by giving yourself a couple hours early to midweek to report, a day or three quarters day midweek to late week to write. Build in overnights with a 2 p.m. deadline, freeing up an afternoon for weekend story or enterprise work. Put in a strong daily Monday to anchor the week and a timeless news feature, profile or human interest story later in the week, that can be used on the weekend.</li>
	<li>News stories break like waves. It's coming (preview), it breaks
(hard news) and recedes (impact, folo, news feature, analysis, preview of
next stage). Think of that wave shape. Ride the wave and you'll get three or more hits off one news event.</li>
	<li>Add a line called FOLO beneath every budget line in your weekbook. After you've finished your story, go back and give yourself leads to follow up: sources not reached, questions unanswered on deadline, possible profiles of people in the news, impact of an event, stories that ask why? And how? instead of just who, what, where and when. Readers' surveys often indicate that one of the things readers dislike is hit and miss coverage, especially one day wonders. Readers want closure. They want the rest of the story. Use the FOLO line to help fill your next weekbook.</li>
	<li>Make your weekbook a living document. Go back and change it, add to it, as the week goes along. It only takes a minute. Then re-mine that weekbook in subsequent weeks.</li>
	<li>If you know you are going to be working on a weekend, start talking to your weekend editor about your story early in the week. There's nothing more awful than a reporter in panic on Thursday afternoon with no idea what to cover on Saturday or Sunday.</li>
</ul>
4. Team up with colleagues. It's challenging, it's fun, it's productive. And
it gives readers from various towns some sense of how news cuts across
municipal boundaries.

5. Keep a tickler file, aka a futures file; fill it with clips, letters,
notes, pictures, labels and related junk of every variety from which story
ideas will emerge. Review it now and then.

6. Don't fall into the rut of thinking there are no good stories on your
beat. Instead, try to attack same-old stories from different, imaginative
angles. Write more stories on how news impacts our towns and people. Write local trend stories. Write community crime trend stories. Write service pieces that inform readers about things they never thought they wanted to know and help readers make decisions. Write local business pieces. Write local environmental stories. Write more people stories, and especially more profiles. People like to read about people. Put a human face on as many stories as you possibly can.

7. Remember <a href="/third/" target="_self">listening posts</a> for increasing the diversity of our sources and scope? Start doing them one day per period, as required. If you can't do a full day, spend a few hours one day and a few hours another day. Add new sources to your regular news coverage. Add new voices to the mix of sources. The Herald News should never become a city/town hall newspaper!

8. We can do the short-term investigation. We can do investigations that depend more on human intelligence than massive data analysis. We can reveal sides of life in our coverage area that no one knows. Try to rethink your investigative ambitions. Go for the clean, short, effective strike. Go for the Wow! Factor: the story that makes readers say to themselves, "Wow, I didn't know that!"

9. Revisit stories. Many reporters know to keep a futures file. Many
know to revisit certain stories on a temporal basis (after one year, five
years, 10 years etc.). This best practice adds another revisit category: the revisit to the incomplete story. Sometimes, try as we might, we simply cannot get the full story by deadline time. Typically, an important source is missing or evasive. Or an agency delays an answer. Or a document can't be obtained. There are many forms of this. We go with what we've got. But when there's a significant hole in the article, we owe it to readers to revisit the story as soon as we can and follow up with a second story or brief. This is especially true when the missing information changes the way we covered the story previously. This best practice speaks to both accuracy and thoroughness- two important parts of getting it right, which is our basic contract with readers.

10. Morgue. Many of you are checking the digital library for articles
going back for years (to 1998) as part of your routine reporting. All of
you should be doing this every day. In addition, however, please don't
forget that the library has a paper morgue going back donkey years. It's a
good practice to check this, particularly when articles involve people who
don't show up in the digital. Ask Mauro Margarelli to help you find the
files you need.

11. Eight Ways to Tell a Story. One of the most useful handouts Warren
Watson of API left behind is the one put together by the York Daily Record editor about the local kid who won a dance contest. She wrote the same story in eight different ways, from inverted period to Q&amp;A, to photo package, blocks, narrative and beyond. This is a handy document that all should have and refer to. If you don't have it, see Jonathan for a copy. If you do have it, use it. God did not hand down the inverted pyramid on stone tablets. Many stories can be told better in other ways. Just as no one likes to eat the exact same thing three times a day, readers, too, want variety. You can still present serious news information in entertaining ways. It just takes thought, creativity and effort. The reporter's job is always to make what she finds relevant interesting for the reader.

<h2>New story forms</h2>
1.Three <strong>Narrative Dailies</strong>.

Narrative journalism is often associated, in journalists' minds, with
lengthy enterprise projects. But there is no law saying narrative techniques cannot be used in dailies or short form. At the recent Niemann Narrative Conference at Harvard, I jotted down three types of daily stories that we could start doing to tell stories in new, interesting and insightful ways for HN readers. Below, three generic budget lines. Use them in good health, with one caveat: narrative doesn't mean you can make it up.

TICKTOCK

We take a news event, breaking or second day reporting. Instead of
organizing from the most important in the lead to the least important at the end, we reconstruct the event over time. What led up to that explosion? What happened the night that cop was murdered? What did that family do on the day they died in a car crash? Exactly what steps did the mayor take that allowed him to pass a zero increase budget? Or, alternatively, what is the aftermath of a particular news event? What happened minute by minute after the plane crashed? What happened to the freeholder in the days and weeks after he dropped out of third grade?

SECONDDRAFT

Journalism is often called the first draft of history. But the first draft
is often abbreviated and cursory, sometimes underreported or skewed, and in some cases, wrong. In this story type, we take a second look at a breaking story, going back to sources for a fuller or better account, taking an unexpected angle or digging out some universal human truth from what at first ran as a brief or rushed deadline piece. The goal is truth, not just facts.

EXPLAINER

Narrative methods focusing on one person can often help readers understand complex, novel or unfamiliar issues and processes better than conventional reporting - which often overlooks the explanatory. Bankruptcy. Identity theft. Outsourcing. Uninsured. Poverty level. Daycare. Drug addiction. Productivity. Deregulation. Bond rating. And on and on. In the explainer, we use one person's story to give readers insight into a hard-to-get-at topic.

2. Three types of <strong>profiles</strong>.

We tend to think of profiles, if we think of them at all, as one thing:
stories about people. It took Bill Blundell, former Page One editor at the
Wall Street Journal has three types of profiles:

a. The General Profile: Concentrates on unique qualities of subject,
aspects of difference: what makes this person unique, different,
outstanding, unusual, unconventional, nontraditional, nonstandard, peculiar, pale and interesting?

b. The Microcosm Profile: centers on aspects of sameness, universality.
In what ways is this person or this person's story typical, universal,
human, like all of us? What part of her or her story can we all connect
with?

c. The News Profile: centers on the subject's connection to a news
event. Also could be called, as the Times does (or used to): Man in the
News. Person in the News?

- <em>Jonathan Maslow</em>, June 2004

<hr />
<h2>The Enterprise project</h2>
In our conference call with Cleveland Plain Dealer writer Connie Schultz, she mentioned several methods that helped her narrative series "The Burden of Innocence," which was the subject of our brown bag writers group. They are excellent practices, not only for narrative journalism, but for any enterprise story.

1) <strong>Write as you go</strong>.

Schultz said she always transcribed her notes as soon as possible and kept them in files organized by month as she worked on the series over the course of one year. Any project that involves reporting over time benefits from having well-organized notes from interviews and reporting. It puts the writer ahead of the curve when you get down to the business of writing. This practice can be easily extended to the practice of writing
themes, sections, scenes, dialogue, good quotes, etc. as you go. Don't imagine you can wait until you're reporting is done, then look back at your notebooks or journal and suddenly pull the white rabbit out of the hat. Doesn't work like that.

2) <strong>Writing a Map/ outline</strong>.

Schultz said that before she started to write, her editor asked for a written map, a term she described as having less onerous associations than outline. The map or outline provides writer and editor with a guide to the story, where it starts, where it goes, what it's about, where it ends. It makes the writer think. It need not be followed like a contract. Whatever it's called, this best practice is one of the quintessential building blocks of longer-length writing. Without it, you are, effectively, roaming around blindfolded, hoping to pin the tail on the donkey. With a roadmap or outline, even if rudimentary (many are the outlines noted on the back of a cocktail napkin; Tolstoy outlined Anna Karenina on a railroad train dining car menu (which, however, later fell behind the sofa at his estate Yasnaya Polyana, forcing him to write War &amp; Peace first instead, but that is another story)).you can focus on the material and how to express it accurately, faily and gracefully, not on what to write next.

3) <strong>Rewriting</strong>.

Schultz said rewriting was the most painful part-- she went through a dozen major drafts. But rewriting is an absolutely necessary practice to achieve successful narratives/enterprise stories. If you are to become a skilled pro writer, you must get past the idea that rewriting means you are doing something wrong. Rewriting is, in fact, doing something right: Improving the story, draft by draft. No story has ever suffered from rewriting. Many suffered from too little rewriting. Just as the map/outline helps the writer through the first draft, the editor's read and conferencing helps the writer through rewrite. Talk out what needs to be done. Partner. Writers don't need to accept everything an editor says, like medicine or punishment. Writers do need to defend and articulate something they want to keep. Develop a collaborative rewrite strategy and get to it.

4) <strong>Writing buddies</strong>.

Scultz said she chooses another writer in the newsroom she respects to critique her pieces, so that she has an additional sounding board outside the editors-reporter loop. Practically every mature writer does this, asking colleagues or friends to read the work and tell the brutal truth. However, this practice really depends on choosing someone with good judgment, analytical skill and the ability to articulate and criticize&gt; constructively. Anything less is less than helpful.

<hr />
<h2><a href="/files/tips/editproofmanual.pdf" target="_new">Edit Proof copy</a></h2>
1. The reporter's constant focus should be on the question: <strong>what is this story about?</strong> That helps shape the lede, the angle, the structure, everything. Also, editors should keep reporters focused on this question throughout the day so that the reporter refines and hones the story to present the reader with a tight, concise, well-organized story without holes, digressions or frills.

2. There's a natural contradiction between the creative process and
critical thinking, between writer or storyteller inside us and the editor or
critic inside. The critic suppresses the storyteller and makes it harder for
the storyteller to tell the story. That's why it's so hard to write a solid
lede: every time the storyteller wants to put a thought down, the critic
says ,"that stinks," "that's not good enough." So Chip Scanlon talked about "lowering your standards" when you draft your story. I think a better way to say this is to suspend your critical faculties while you are writing your first draft and just get it down using your creative juices. Then switch over to your critical faculties to rewrite, sharpen, trim, etc.

3. <strong>A topic is not a story</strong>. You can't write about AIDS, or mass transit, or affordable housing. Those are topics. A story has to have a beginning, middle and end. It has to have characters. It has to have a plot.
It has to have a setting. This is a cogent point. How many times do editors hear from reporters, "I want to write about poverty in Paterson." "I want to write about the Passaic River." "I want to write about race relations between latinos and blacks." How many times do reporters hear from editors: "We should do a story about high property taxes." Well what about it? Themes are not stories. Think about telling stories. It's elemental.

4. Words of wisdom from Don Murray, a legendary writing coach, on
organizing and "mapping" the reporting and writing of a story: <strong>explore, focus, rehearse, draft, clarify</strong>.

5. Experienced reporters know what is the least amount of reporting
they need to do for any given story. Great reporters know there is no limit
except deadline for reporting, and that the quality of a story really, truly
depends on the reporting, not the writing. If you don't know as many facts
and factoids as you possibly can, the story is going to be thin and pale.
Somebody said, "Reporting is taking a beer keg information and squeezing it into a perfume bottle.

6. A good way to start the process: reporter and editor brainstorm
on reader's questions. What does the reader need to and want to know about the story. That helps the reporter focuse on question above: What is this story about?

7. Rick Bragg's five boxes. NY Times reporter Rick Bragg learned
from a mentor that he should organize and write his stories as if he had
five empty boxes floating in the air above him: In the first box, he put the
lede or grabber. In the second, the nut graf: what's this story about. In
the third box, tell the story. In the fourth, info, context, back story,
etc. And in the fifth, the kicker, the ending, something that leaves the
reader with emotional meaning.

8. Jack Hart, enterprise editor at The Oregonian: Don't confuse
anecdotes in anecdotal ledes with scenesetters. <strong>Anecdotes are little stories, with their own beginning and end. Scenesetters just get the reader to the right "place."</strong>

9. Get rid of dependent clauses in your sentences.

10. <strong>To revise, you need to achieve distance</strong>. You can't plunge right into a revision. You have to take a break, do something else for a while, eat something or drink something, divert your attention, go for a walk, something. Everyone finds their own way to get a distance on his/her own work. Whatever cools the engine down then revs it up again.

- <em>Jonathan Maslow</em>, May 2005

<hr />
<h2>Story conception and execution</h2>
- From notes taken during <a href="http://www.journalism.missouri.edu/faculty/jacqui-banaszynski.html" target="_new">Jacqui Banaszynski's</a> visit to the Herald News on Aug. 14, 2004.

We have to tell people what the news means and what's its significance.

When you get a story assignment, immediately sit down and brainstorm for five minutes.

Brainstorm questions, not even to necessarily use in an interview.

Anything you think you know, turn it into a question.

Ask yourself:
<ul>
	<li>What do you want to know?</li>
	<li>What are you curious about?</li>
	<li>Who are the stakeholders in the story?</li>
</ul>
At the end of the day, do this again so you have ideas for second day stories.

On most stories, you write the first-day story. On the second day, you do a story that's very wide, takes in all the questions but is not very deep.

Instead, do six or seven deep stories of varying types:
<ul>
	<li>Profiles - character-based</li>
	<li>Issues/trends - ideas, fashion</li>
	<li>Investigative - records-based</li>
	<li>Explanatory - a teachable moment</li>
	<li>Descriptive/voices - use telling details</li>
	<li>Narratives - scenes &amp; dialogue</li>
	<li>Visuals - using graphics and boxes to tell the story</li>
</ul>
Editors want a working <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&amp;aid=34457" target="_new">nut graf</a> when you pitch a story. Do some preliminary reporting.

Each editor is looking for something different, get to know each of them.

Writing a budget line helps you establish goals. Write your working budget line as questions.
<ul> "This story is about _____"

"It's happening because _____"

"It's important because _____"</ul>
Find a colleague who will read your ledes in progress and to discuss story craft with.

Ledes engage the reader. Don't misdirect the reader. Lede them with foreshadowing and summarize.

Unlike the AP, don't frontload a lot of information.

The lede should signal the tone and voice of the story.

Vary the pacing and rhythm and length of your sentences. Long sentences read fast. Then a short sentance halts the reader.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act's privacy rule went into effect in 2003, it has become increasingly difficult for journalists to get information about the health care and treatment of individuals. My former colleague, health reporter Betsy Querna, recommends the <a href="http://www.healthjournalism.org/" target="_new">Association of Health Care Journalists'</a> primer on the federal law:
<blockquote>...there are a number of public policy exceptions under the Privacy Rule that permit the disclosure of protected health information without an individualâs authorization.  For example, covered entities may disclose information for treatment purposes, for certain law enforcement or public health oversight purposes, or in accordance with a court order.  (This list is not exhaustive.)

Additionally, the following are NOT protected health information: police and fire incident reports, and court records. Also, birth records and autopsy records are not protected health information to the extent they are maintained by state agencies.  In addition, if a state FOIA law designates death records and/or autopsy reports as public information that must be disclosed, covered entities may disclose that protected health information without an authorization.

Hospitals may maintain directories of patients, although patients can ask to be kept out of the directory and health care professionals use their professional judgment with regard to what directory information (if any) to include about incapacitated individuals. <strong>When someone calls and asks about a patient by name whose information is in the directory, the hospital may reveal where the patient is located in the hospital and information about the patientâs general condition (including whether the patient has died, or whether the patient has been treated and released)</strong>.

<strong>To release additional information to a reporter, a hospital must obtain written authorization from the patient (or the patientâs parent or guardian in the case of minors). That document does not have to be notarized or witnessed.</strong> The American Hospital Associationâs Web site, <a href="http://www.aha.org" target="_blank">http://www.aha.org</a>, provides a checklist of what should be included in an authorization form, along with other guidance on HIPAA.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most people know of Lexis-Nexis as a collector of newspaper and wire service archives. You are probably familiar with it from searching through the past stories of the New York Times or other papers. But its true value for journalists and investigators lies in the many government databases that it allows you to search.

To get started, you need to get a log-in and password through your news organization. Once you have one, go to <a href="http://www.nexis.com" target="_new">www.nexis.com</a>.

Nexis is immensely helpful in <a href="/backgrounding/">backgrounding</a> a subject. Be warned, however, that you should not use Nexis as a primary source. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Always double-check any information you get on it with human sources before putting it into print</span>. Many of its databases contain peoples' birthdays. You will find that it often gets the month and year right, but not the date.

When you first enter Nexis, you will see the "Easy Search" page. Click the tab to the left of it that reads "Power Search". This allows you to choose which Nexis databases you want to search.

On the dialog that says "Select a source", look to the right of the pull-down menu and click on the link that says "Find More Sources...".

Under the source menu, click on the "Browse Sources" tab. This will bring you to a directory screen that lists all of the various types of searches you can do. You want to click on the folder that reads "Public Records". These are the invaluable databases of nationwide and state records.

If, for example, you want to look through New Jersey's voter registration databases, click on "Voter Registrations". On the next screen, if you click on the icon of the document next to "NJ Voter Registrations", it will bring up the information on what the source contains, where the data comes from and how often its updated. Click to check the box next to NJ Voter Registrations, then hit the red "OK-Continue" button.

This will return you to the main search page. You can enter your search term into the box and click "Search". Once you add a new database to your Power Search, you will be able to find it again from the main page by clicking on the drop-down menu. If it ever disappears from the drop-down, you can always go back to "Find More Sources" and find it again.

For tips on search terms, read this <a href="/files/tips/nexischeatsheet.pdf" target="_new">cheat sheet</a> from Columbia University. If you're searching for "Tom Meagher", type in "Meagher, T!" to find everyone whose last name is Meagher and first name starts with T. Play with it and look around.

Some of the best databases to use:
<ul>
	<li>NJ Deed Transfers, Tax Assessor Records and Mortgage Records - Selected Counties, under Real Property</li>
	<li>NJ Voter Registrations</li>
	<li>NJ Professional Licenses</li>
	<li>NJ Judgment and Lien Filings</li>
	<li>NJ Tax Liens, Federal and State</li>
	<li>NJ Uniform Commercial Code Lien Filings, listed under "Judgments and Liens"</li>
	<li>Bankruptcy filings</li>
	<li>UCC filings</li>
	<li>SEC filings (particularly the 10-K records)</li>
	<li>Social Security death records</li>
	<li>Person locator</li>
	<li>NJ Criminal History records (note that these are generally only about 7 years of state felony convictions. If you want to find federal cases, use <a href="https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl?court_id=00idx" target="_new">PACER</a>.)</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"We do not expect reporters to be mathematical geniuses. But we do expect them to sidestep their mind-numbing fear of mathematics long enough to ask, <strong>'Does this make sense?' 'What would I conclude from these numbers?'</strong>"
<ul>-A.K. Dewdney, in his book 200% of Nothing</ul>
"Selecting the right number for just the right place in a story depends on the same news judgment you use in selecting just the right quote, anecdote or image."
<ul> - Sarah Cohen in Numbers In the Newsroom: Using Math &amp; Statistics in News</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr />Some reasons why we as reporters (and editors and photographers and artists) hate and fear math:
<ul>
	<li>There was no math required in J-school.</li>
	<li>We wear math ignorance (or "innumeracy") as a badge of honor.</li>
	<li>We've already got a math nerd in the newsroom, so why bother?</li>
	<li>My source will give me all the numbers I need.</li>
</ul>
Why you need to understand a few basics about math:
<ul>
	<li>Numbers are a summary of life. We think they imply a sense of concrete precision that they do not.</li>
	<li>Many numbers are a guess.</li>
	<li>Many numbers are an opinion.</li>
</ul>
Some handy rules of thumb on writing with numbers when all else fails:
<ul>
	<li>Try to keep the numbers you include in a story to a minimum. Never use more than two or three numbers in a paragraph. This includes dates, times, years and spelled-out numbers.
<blockquote>For example this sentence:

"The Office of Redundancy's budget rose 48 percent in 2006, from $700.3 million to $1.03 billion in 2007."

â¦can be more simply rewritten as:

"Over the past year, the Office of Redundancy's budget grew by nearly half, to $1 billion."</blockquote>
</li>
	<li>Similarly, avoid writing more than one paragraph in a row that contains numbers.</li>
	<li>Learn to round off decimals-DON'T just chop off decimal places. Then, round some more to make a number manageable</li>
	<li>Know the common numbers on your beat so that you can easily place new numbers in perspective. (for example - median incomes, population, budget totals, tests scores, homicides, batting averages)</li>
	<li>Use precise language, but don't try to make your numbers more precise than they really are.</li>
	<li>Save your numbers for graphics-bar charts, tables or even a break-out box.</li>
	<li>Use the tools you already have at your disposal. Use the calculator on your computer. Learn Excel and have it do the hard calculations for you. Also, Google has a built-in <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator" target="_new">calculator</a>. For example, if you want to divide 8,345,089 by 31, just type this into the search engine and press enter: 8345089/31It will return this answer: 269,196.419 (rounded off)</li>
	<li>Always double check your math. Does the number make sense? Whenever you have a story with any numbers in it, print out a copy before you file it. Circle every number in it and go back and double check each one.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Working with numbers</span></h3>
Numbers on their own, without any context, tell us very little. When we're reporting a story, and we include a number, say $9 million, we do our readers a disservice when we don't put it in perspective. If you're writing about a municipal property tax bill, a $9 million deficit out of a $180 million budget is fairly significant.

If you're writing about Bill Gates' dry-cleaning bill of $9 million, that's a drop in the bucket for a man worth nearly $27 billion.

The way to put numbers into perspective is using ratios or rates-comparisons between two numbers.

<strong>Fractions</strong>

The most common ratio is the fraction. We use the fraction to reduce the scale of a very large number while putting it into perspective.

We can take the municipal property tax deficit and express it as a fraction of the total city budget:

To look at a fraction, the top number (or numerator) is compared to the larger whole (or the denominator).
<blockquote>So our tax bill as a fraction is:
<ul>9,000,000/180,000,000</ul>
You can also express this as:
<ul>9/180</ul>
You can simplify this even further by dividing the top and bottom of the fraction by 9:
<ul>1/20</ul>
</blockquote>
So the $9 million deficit accounts for 1/20th of the city budget. But it's only 1/3,000th of Bill Gates' current net worth.

<strong>Percents</strong>

A percent is a ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. It's the same thing as a fraction.

1/20th is the same as 5 percent or, as a decimal, .05. How do you figure this out? Go to your calculator and type in 1 divided by 20. That will give you .05. You can either multiply that by 100 or just move the decimal point two spots to the right.

So how do you figure a percent when you're dealing with something bigger?
<blockquote>Step 1: Determine the base, or total number, of what you are looking at, or the sum of all the numbers involved.

Step 2: Divide the portion you're looking at by the base.

Step 3: Multiply that number by 100 to get the percentage

Step 4: Round and simplify</blockquote>
You want to know the percentage of how many times a basketball player has hit his three-point shots over the season. You counted that he sank 37 baskets from the three-point line and he missed 61 shots.
<blockquote>Step 1: The base is the total number of attempts = 37 baskets + 61 missed shots = 98

Step 2: Rate = 37 out of 98 = 37/98 = .37755102â¦

Step 3: Percent = .37755102â¦ x 100 = 37.755102â¦ percent

Step 4: Round and simplify = 37.8 percent,

or <em>more than a third</em> of his chances resulted in baskets.</blockquote>
If you want to reverse a percentage to get a simple fraction:
<blockquote>Say you start with 25 percent.

Write it as a fraction: 25 out of (per) 100 (cent), or 25/100.

You want to find the least common denominator, or the largest whole number that will go into both the top and the bottom. In this case, that number is 25, divide the top and bottom by 25 and you get Â¼ or 1 out of 4.</blockquote>
<strong>Rates and ratios</strong>

Rates and ratios are particularly useful in comparing unlike things, in leveling the playing field and in making sense out of very small numbers.

For instance, crime rates can help you compare the amount of crime in two very different places with different populations, by putting them on equal footing.
<ul>In 2005, New York City had 539 murders. Paterson had 20 murders. Which town had the higher murder rate, or the most murders per capita (or resident)?

You figure the rate by dividing the number of murders by the total population. Paterson's population in 2005 was 151,200. So 20 murders divided by 151,200 residents equals .000132275 murders per city resident.

That doesn't really make sense, because it's difficult for us to conceptualize what .000132275 murders looks like. So in these kind of cases (and murder rates in general), we figure the rate per 100,000 city residents.
<blockquote>Step 1: Figure the base

Step 2: Figure the proportion (the portion divided by the base)

Step 3: Multiply the proportion by 100,000

Step 4: Round to the nearest whole number.</blockquote>
For Paterson, that looks like this:
<blockquote>Step 1: The base is 151,200 residents.

Step 2: The proportion = 20/151,200 = .000132275

Step 3: .000132275 x 100,000 = 13.2275 murders per 100,000 residents

Step 4: 13 murders per 100,000 people in Paterson in 2005.</blockquote>
How did New York look that year?
<blockquote>Step 1: New York's population in 2005 was 8,115,690

Step 2: 539 murders per 8,115,690 = 539/8,115,690 = 6.641456240935767630355521218775e-5 murders per New Yorker, or a number so small I don't even know how to express it. But your calculator does.

Step 3: 6.641456240935767630355521218775e-5 x 100,000 = 6.641456241 murders per 100,000 residents

Step 4: 7 murders per 100,000 people in New York in 2005.</blockquote>
When it came to getting killed in 2005, you would have been almost twice as likely to be murdered in Paterson (13 per 100,000) than in New York City (7 per 100,000).</ul>
<strong>Percent change</strong>

Percent change is one of the most misunderstood numbers in reporting, yet it's also one of the easiest to calculate.

Last year, 6,871 voters cast ballots for school board members. This year, 7,487 voters made it to the polls. What's the percent change?
<blockquote>Step 1: Find the difference in the numbers. To do this, you subtract the old number from the new number. (It doesn't matter which one is bigger, only which one is more recent; this can be a negative number), or New - Old = Difference

Step 2: Divide the difference by the old number, or Difference/Old

Step 3: Multiply by 100 to get the percent change

Step 4: Round off and simplify</blockquote>
So in this voting example:
<blockquote>Step 1: 7,487 - 6,871 = 616

Step 2: 616/6,871 = .089652

Step 3: .089652 x 100 = 8.9652 percent

Step 4: Round and simplify: 9 percent or, nearly a tenth</blockquote>
The mnemonic device I use to remember this is "NOO!" It stands for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"New minus Old divided by Old"</span></strong>.

(New-Old)/Old = percent change

<strong>Averages, means, medians and modes</strong>

When summarizing a large group of numbers, there are several different ways to describe it. Each way can potentially tell a different story.

What is commonly called the average is also known as the mean. This is a simple average that is calculated by adding up a list of numbers and dividing that sum by the total count.

The median value is the middle value in a list of numbers. To find this, put your list of numbers in order from lowest to highest and find the middle number. If you have an even number of numbers, figure the average of the two numbers in the center of the list.

The mode is the most common value in a list of numbers.

Why does all this matter? You need to understand these descriptions and what they represent so you are prepared to deal with sources who might try to manipulate you.
<ul>
	<li>In the 1994-1995 Major League baseball strike, one of the largest bones of contention was the issue of salaries.</li>
	<li>The owners argued that the mean salary for players was $1.2 million.</li>
	<li>But the median annual salary in the league was $350,000, and the mode salary was $100,000.</li>
	<li>Why was there a difference? Which one would you report, and why?</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common math pitfalls</span></strong>
<ul>
	<li>Packing too many numbers into a story. You can almost see the readers' eyes glaze over when they try to wade through a story that's sinking in a morass of numbers. Be judicious about what numbers you use.</li>
	<li>The illusion of false precision. Numbers are usually out of date the second they're collected, and they are often based on small samples, rounded numbers and guesses of all kinds. For your stories, a rounded number is sometimes more accurate than the number with eight decimal places.</li>
	<li>Overcooking. You can't simply average a set of averages and expect to get a number that means anything.
<ul>
	<li>
<ul>Teachers: $35,000

Classroom aides: $19,000

Administrators: $65,000</ul>
<ul> There are 35 teachers in the district that make an average of $35,000.

There are 10 classroom aides that make an average of $19,000.

There are 5 administrators that make an average of $65,000.

To get a weighted average:

35 x 35,000 = 1,225,000

10 x 19,000 = 190,000

5 x 65,000 = 325,000

1,225,000+190,000+325,000 = 1,740,000

1,740,000 / 50 school employees = $34,800, the true average salary in the district.</ul>
</li>
In last year's school budget, you see that various positions made, on average, the following salaries:

What's the average salary in the district? Your first inclination might be to just average these together, or add the three numbers together and divide by three. That would give you an "average" of $39,666. That would be wrong, because it doesn't take into account how many people work in each of these jobs.</ul>
</li>
	<li>Losing sight of the base. It's difficult to quote a percentage (or percent change), when you're describing a group of numbers that are fewer than 100. Smaller numbers can generate big percentages. It might create the illusion of a greater amount of change than is actually happening.</li>
	<li>Very few of your sources know how to do math either. A good example from Ashley Kindergan: a municipal official lectured the city council about rising water rates.
<ul> The water rate in 2005 was $5.

The water rate in 2006 was $7.

The water rate in 2007 was $9.

The rate increased by 40% from 2005 to 2006, and it rose by 29% from 2006 to 2007. Therefore, the official said, the rate had increased by 69 percent from 2005 to 2007. He simply added the yearly percent changes. That doesn't work! He needed to do the total percent change from 2005 to 2007:  (9-5)/5 = 80%

That's a big difference from 69 percent.</ul>
</li>
	<li>Ignoring the little voice inside your head. Sometimes when a source hands us a number, we take it at face value, even when it flies counter to everything else we know. Make sure a number stands up to common sense and your gut check.</li>
</ul>

Calculating <strong>Percentage Change</strong>: (NEW - OLD)/OLD * 100 = % CHANGE

or ((NEW/OLD)-1)*100 = % CHANGE

Calculating <strong>Proportion</strong>: (# OF PARTS/ TOTAL) * 100 = % OF WHOLE

Calculating <strong>Rates</strong>: (INCIDENTS/POPULATION) *10,000 (OR 100,000-DEPENDING ON THE POPULATION)

Calculating <strong>Ratios</strong>: Take the first two numbers being compared and divide by second: 600/30=20. Ration is 20 to 1. If answer is a fraction, round off.

Calculating <strong>Inflation</strong>: (CONSUMER PRICE INDEX NOW/ CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THEN)* SALES THEN = SALES THEN IN TODAY'S MONEY.

<em>Excerted from <a href="http://www.mattbaron.com" target="_new">Matt Baron's</a> "Go Figure" column, Nov. 2002</em> -

"...Folks have the darnedest habit of using quantitative terms that
are disguised as humdrum everyday words. I call these near-numerical buggers "cuties," in recognition of the QT abbreviation of "quantitative terms."

Occasionally, people actively seek out the cutie costume. Usually, though, it's just the way we normally communicate. All right, I'm being mathematically mischievous-go back and catch the three cuties in the last two sentences.

Find them? If not, you will see them again in this partial listing of cuties
compiled now to help you spot the garments they wear:
Consistently, constantly, conventionally, customarily, frequently,
habitually, incessantly, increasingly, infrequently, intermittently, mostly,
normally, occasionally, oftentimes, periodically, regularly, religiously,
repeatedly, routinely, seasonally, sporadically, traditionally, typically,
usually.

OK, two dozen cuties ought to be enough to convey the point.

When you are in the semantic/numeric trenches and encounter these or similar cuties, you have two choices:

1. Make a mental or written note of the cutie, and be sure to get back to it.

2. Get a clarification right away.

Prompt them with some quantitative parameters. If they say something occurs "frequently" or "occasionally," then offer a range of numbers per day, week, month, year or whatever is appropriate.

If they say "a couple" or "a few" or "several," try to steer it toward a specific number or range of numbers. And if your efforts irk them, let them know without those specifics, there may not be a story here at all. Of course, you'll often need to seek out others to verify or refute the information.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are some helpful ideas, culled from various seminars, on conceiving, organizing and executing an enterprise project. I also now see that much of this is covered in the book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NAlJW0Sof5MC&lpg=PA9&ots=rBL9xyFCdl&dq=paul%20williams%20investigative%20reporting%20and%20editing&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=paul%20williams%20investigative%20reporting%20and%20editing&f=false" target="_new">"The reporter's handbook: an investigator's guide to documents and techniques"</a> by Steve Weinberg of IRE. 
<h2>The Paul Williams way</h2>
He wrote a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Investigative-Reporting-Editing-Paul-Williams/dp/0135046629" target="_new">Investigative Reporting and Editing</a> that laid out these steps:
<ol>
	<li>Conception of investigation:
<ul> a.	one-time tips
b.	figure out how to deal with the crazies
c.	regular source cultivation
d.	clips</a>, <a href="/best-practices/legal-ads/">legal ads</a>, professional newsletters (for other professions, doctors, chemists, <a href="http://www.njslom.org/" target="_new">league of municipalities</a>)
e.	angle after the one-time story
f.	looking: walk-arounds, drive arounds of municipality</ul>
</li>
	<li>Feasibility
<ul> a.	obstacles - be honest and brutal
b.	resources - <a href="/best-practices/docs/">document</a> availability, reporter aid availability
c.	competition on it?</ul>
</li>
	<li>Go or No Go Decision?
<ul> a.	have you promised the minimum story?
b.	Base building - research list for standards. What should be happening?
c.	Create a timeline. It will show you your gaps.</ul>
</li>
	<li>Planning
<ul> a.	organize files
b.	duties
c.	schedule - plot it out, day by day
d.	<a href="/best-practices/opra/">OPRA</a> needs</ul>
</li>
	<li>Original research
<ul> a.	paper and data trails
b.	people trails
c.	reevaluate along the way
d.	how often?
e.	Analysis of gaps?
f.  Make sure the story is still about humans, not just numbers</ul>
</li>
	<li>Writing and rewriting
<ul> a.	outline or write first draft and then try to write an outline based on that
b.	chronology
c.	write a lede every day and see how appropriate it is
d.	bring in graphics folks</ul>
</li>
	<li>Publication
<ul> a.	devise a follow-up plan. Next day phone calls.</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
Another plan for organizing the piles of paper and data you will compile in the process of reporting out a project, based on a seminar led by <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/jo_craven_mcginty/index.html" target="_new">Jo Craven McGinty</a> at the 2005 <a href="http://www.saja.org/" target="_new">SAJA</a> conference:


<strong>Type</strong> your notes immediately after each bout of reporting
Write a draft of the story and lede from those notes.
Dealing with your notes immediately helps you capture the moment.

<strong>Label</strong> - Save and label spreadsheets, databases and folders

<strong>Reshuffle</strong> - That tottering pile of paper on your desk needs to be put in some coherent order. Create a manilla folder for each document and its accompanying memo. You should also create this for your electronic records. The names of the folder should correspond to the filenames on your computer.

<strong>Reclick</strong> - Make folders on your desktop (both real and virtual) to track these types of material:
<ul>
	<li>News clips</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ire.org/resourcecenter/tipsheets.php" target="_new">IRE tipsheets</a></li>
	<li>Official (government) reports</li>
	<li>Correspondence</li>
	<li>Data</li>
	<li>Audits</li>
	<li>Memos</li>
	<li>Sources (interviews)</li>
	<li>Stories in progress</li>
	<li>Other (scrap folder)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Save Everything!</strong> - Even the scrap. You never know when or how it will come in handy, but it will.

<strong>Track</strong> correspondence and calls, including dates, times, and exchanges, with public agencies, especially in a <a href="/files/tips/projecttracking.xls">spreadsheet</a>

For your out-going correspondence, save the letters in Microsoft Word files. Save the date the letter was sent as part of the file's name.

For each document, she'll write herself a one-page memo to summarize it. This is especially helpful when you start getting government reports and audits that run into the hundreds of pages. She then uses Excel again to keep track of documents, memos and people.

<strong>Audit</strong> - Keep track of how you run any database analyses

For CAR, she writes down the question she wants to answer in English, then answers it, writing down the query and the result, in a memo to herself

<strong>Annotate</strong> - Your memos and stories

<strong>Conceptual revision</strong> - Create a spreadsheet to answer questions for youself about how the reporting is going. At the top of each column will be a question:
<ol>
	<li>What do I believe to be true?</li>
	<li>What do I know to be true?</li>
	<li>What can I prove?</li>
	<li>What do I need to prove what I believe?</li>
</ol>
I have found this <a href="/files/tips/projecttracking.xls">tracking spreadsheet</a> to be very helpful in guiding the whole she-bang.

<h3>Covering small and local businesses</h3>
Most small papers don't (or can't) cover businesses in the sense of corporate profits and CEO job changes. But business is crucial in how it affects the individual lives of owners and employees, along with municipal fiscal health.<br>
<br>
Some ideas to start:<br>
- At least three-fourths of people now work for small companies. Covering local small businesses is far more important than dissecting Hoffmann-La Roche.<br>
- Many local businesses are family-run operations with deep roots in the area. Looking at these family trees is fascinating. Many of these individuals have played rolls in the greater civic life of the area.<br>
- More people are running home-based businesses. These range from concierge services to computer consultants. Some of these people were laid off from corporate America; others are stay at home moms; still more need to supplement their full-time income with part-time work.<br>
<br>
Opportunities for business coverage:<br>
- Anniversaries-look out for those bread trucks that say "founded in 1907."<br>
- Holidays-to honor Valentine's Day, what's the story of the local candy story? How about looking at the Peruvian business for Peruvian Independence Day?<br>
 -Openings/Closings-these need to have an extra hook, because our policy is to not cover balloon-festooned grand openings. Maybe the opening represents some larger trend of economic growth in the area, or is bucking a trend. Closings of old businesses is always a wonderful opportunity for poignant nostalgia. Closings of big companies are notable for the jobs/ratables they will shed.<br>
- Expansions-things are going so well for business X, that they expanded and are hiring more employees. What is the key to their success? Is it paying part time workers and denying people benefits. Overseas contracts? More government work?<br>
- Quirky businesses-old school Italians printing Hip Hop CD labels? The former coffin business now selling party tents? These are out there.<br>
<br>
Data sources:<br>
-	<a href="http://www.census.gov/" target="_new">Census</a>: A great source of data is the <a href="http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp/index.html" target="_new">County Business Patterns</a>, which gives annual business stats by county. It lists firms broken down by size for hundreds of different trades and professions.<br>
-	<a href="http://www.state.nj.us/labor/" target="_new">State Labor department</a>: They have salaries and number of employees for dozens of professions. It's in their <a href="http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/lpa/tools/datatools_index.html" target="_new">occupational employment statistics</a>.<br>
-	<a href="http://www.dol.gov/" target="_new">Federal Labor department</a>: They track monthly job growth nationally (and some things for the state), wage trends for industries, along with dozens of other interesting things (like which line of work is the most dangerous.)<br>
-	<br>
Local/state Groups:<br>
-	<a href="http://www.wpunj.edu/cob/COB_new/sbdc/sbdc.htm" target="_new">William Paterson Small Business Development Center</a><br>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Questions: <br>
How many properties does a particular landlord own in the borough?<br>
How much did he pay for them?<br>
How quickly did he sell them?<br>
For how much profit?<br>
<br>
It's very easy to answer all of these questions and come back with answers that can create a powerful new sense of who some of the major private players are in a town. Large real estate developers frequently have relationships with town politicians. They also have a big influence in how people find dwellings and their conditions. What tenant wouldn't want to know about the owner of their property? How about neighbors of a future development?<br>
<br>
Additionally, general real estate trends in a borough have a big influence on residents. Are old residents being priced out? Are home prices sinking? Are people getting traditional, 30-year mortgages, or having to resort to risky (subprime) loans with high interest rates and fees? Are areas going to be rezoned?<br>
<br>
Doing real estate research can be stories in themselves, as in talking to local real estate representatives about who is moving into town and what they are paying. Or they can add more depth to a news story. When someone comes to a council meeting asking for zoning rights or approval of a new project, find out more about the person and his company. <br>
<br>
Some approaches:<br>
1.	Much of the research can be done from <a href="http://www.lexis.com/" target="_new">Lexis</a>. Start with the "legal" tab, and go to New Jersey. Then click on NJ Public Records Combined. Start running searches with what you have (the name of the developer, the company name, or the property address). Any document that says DEED will contain stuff like buyer/seller, the price, the block and lot and the mortgage company. One piece of information will often help you fill in what you don't have (like figuring out if someone owns many different real estate LLC's.) <br>
2.	Once you are in Lexis and have a real estate owner's name, it's worth it <a href="/best-practices/backgrounding/">to background</a> them. Of prime interest is if they have previous lawsuits against them. Look in NJ Public Records Combined and NJ Combined Civil Filings, to start. Have they sued a lot of tenants or sought to foreclose on them? Have companies sued them for debts? What other people are named with them in the suits? Do they own a lot of property?<br>
3.	Also look for criminal records.<br>
4.	If they own other companies (often LLC's), go to the state <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/njbgs/" target="_new">Business Gateway</a> to buy company status reports. Once you receive it, check who is named as president and other corporate officers. <br>
5.	If you have a block and lot or address of a particular project, go to the municipality and request the paper file (often in planning or engineering department). Digging through here can turn up development plans, records of permits obtained (for improvements, for example), and other goodies. <br>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The best journalists constantly strive to improve their craft and become even better. The best way to become better is through taking advantage of every training opportunity you can.

Many news organizations offer in-house training, but the best way to learn is to interact with the best minds in the business. The way to find them is through the many wonderful seminars and conferences offered by the leading journalism organizations in the country.

It would behoove you to be aware of upcoming conferences and seminars. To borrow a bit of jargon, you should be "proactive" in seeking out these opportunities and pitching them to your editors. Realize, however, that most newspapers have a limited training budget each year. Any time that you can, you ought to apply for fellowships and sponsorships to training events.
Here's a list of wonderful organizations whose conferences and seminars, I have benefited from over the past few years.

<title>The Weekbook</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The primary purpose of weekbooks is as a practical way of communicating with editors and colleagues about the stories you are pursuing. The secondary purpose is to give the city desk budget lines to insert into the daily budget in an efficient manner.

Keep a running list of enterprise stories at the bottom of your weekbook, which may be carried over week to week.

A really good practice: add a line called FOLO to your daily budget lines after you finish your daily. The FOLO line should include such things as what you see as the folo-up story, unanswered questions, unreached sources, issues that could be turned into weekenders, people from dailies you want to profile, etc. The FOLO line can help you and the desk to know where a story is going, strengthen your beat reporting performance, and serve as an easy
way to file a better weekbook with good story selection.

<strong>Evening meetings</strong>. Decide well ahead of time by studying agendas and talking to sources whether a meeting will produce a story. If you decide it won't, don't go. If it will, then you should decide either a) to file a story, even short, that night for the next day's edition and follow up next
day with a second day story, if necessary; or b) if you cannot file that night, do a walkup/preview on the news issue to run the same day of the evening meeting. Then follow up the day after the meeting, if necessary (result, new development, conflict, etc.). This best practice requires a
little additonal forethought; it won't hurt.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[By <a href="http://www.eliotcaroom.com/" target="_blank">Eliot Caroom</a>, New Jersey Local News Service reporter, Nov. 2010

Shooting and editing journalistic video for the web can be incredibly  fun. The hard part is creating video under a tight deadline that's fun for the viewer and also works with the story.

To start, youâll need a camera and editing software.  The software choice will be pretty simple depending on  your price range and OS.  As for a camera, first make sure that the camera produces a video file type your software can edit.  Read reviews and consider low light performance and audio, both the quality and whether you can plug in an external mic. Think about buying a great camera that came out last yearâthe price has dropped, and you can see from other customers how reliable the camera turned out to be on a ratings site like <a href="http://www.newegg.com" target="_blank">Newegg.com</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>. Go beyond the 5-star count on reviews and read what people have to say.  The hive mind knows all.

<strong>Core ideas</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
</span>Substance: look for a story with a compelling visual element (action sports, volunteerism, charismatic or weird-looking characters doing what they do).

Get to the good stuff right away: Viewers drop like flies (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-video-abandonment-rate-2010-10" target="_blank">exhibit a</a>), so immediate action is a winner, instead of title cards with lots of words, a boring talking head or the exterior of an office building. Expensive web video bootcamps like Michael Rosenblum's often instruct noobs to open with the strongest action and tell the story around it, instead of trying to write a script beforehand and then fitting your best footage into the gaps.

Brevity is important:  By the 3-minute mark, you are likely the only one still watching your video.  Also, viewers smell boredom when they see a  long duration at the bottom of the video like â4:50.â

<strong>Checklist before shooting</strong>
There's nothing worse than sitting down to edit and realizing your footage is useless because of a catastrophic mistake.  Keep these five things in mind to avoid forehead-palm later.
1. Audio. Plug headphones into the camera and listen to the audio to make sure the levels arenât faint or overpowering. Listen for distracting background noises.  If you are in a quiet room near a fountain or a running refrigerator, that can be bad.  If you're outdoors near car traffic, that is not good.  Consider walking away from the noise. Keep checking the headphones as you shoot to make sure all is well.

2. Lighting. Try to shoot your subject with bright lighting at your back. Unless you want a silhouette, don't aim a camera at someone who is between you and the sun. Keep the sun behind you and  in front of them.  When indoors, watch out for bright windows backlighting the interviewee. If you use lighting, remember that direct light is harsh and casts shadows, and diffuse light (bounced off walls) is softer. For more advanced lighting advice, <a href="http://video.about.com/desktopvideo/Lighting--Three-Simple-Setups.htm" target="_blank">go here</a>.

3. A clean, steady shot. For stability, use a tripod or brace your arm against your body and lean against a chair or wall.  Remember, zooms make a picture shake. Get closer to your subject when you can instead of using the zoom, for either action or a sit-down.  Keep sit-down interviews relatively clutter-free.  This means no lamps, plants or outdoor light poles behind the subjectâs head, impaling them.  Also, your camera should have a button or a menu that automatically adjusts the white balance setting. Donât skip this step.

4.  B-roll. Variety makes a video rich and faster-paced.  While you may be focused on capturing âthe main event,â i.e. an interview, song, or speech, take a little time before and after to record the subject in their natural habitat, and shoot closeups of special physical features/activities/surroundings. Make sure you have a good number of close-up shots.

5.  Make a list. You can't always get what you want.  But if you try, most times, you get what you need.  Think of an asset list of the visuals you want to capture and the topics you want to cover in your interview.  Donât forget basic reporting staples like name spellings, ages and occupations of people.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[About six months ago now, I started a new job, taking over as The Star-Ledger's Computer-Assisted Reporting Editor. For anyone who follows me on Twitter, this may help explain why many of my online comments lately have dealt with statistics, data visualizations and programming.

In a slight departure from my day-to-day role working with numbers, I was asked to fill in for one of my bosses at a symposium hosted by John Jay College's <a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/centers/media_crime_justice/3411.htm" target="_blank">Center on Media, Crime and Justice</a>. The round table discussion brought together police and journalists from across New Jersey to talk about working together and how using social media tools can help all of us do our jobs.

It was an interesting day to say the least. I sat in a room with 45 cops, reporters and editors who often have an adversarial relationship. I met cops who my reporters have been interviewing for years, as well as competitors whose bylines I knew well. It was refreshing to step out of the daily grind for a few hours and talk about our shared frustrations and how we can do things better, particularly with the explosion of social media tools at our fingertips.

<iframe width="500" height="314" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lFZ0z5Fm-Ng?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

After the jump, some of my prepared remarks, without the slight diversions I took when I delivered them.
<!--more-->

<h2>What the public and the news media want from the police on the internet</h2>
1. Speed. Like news organizations and police departments everywhere, we have seen our resources dwindle. At the same time, competition has grown exponentially. We want the information fast. We want to know what's happening before it happens and then we want to be able to alert our readers.

It can buy police departments time. If you get a tweet out quickly to alert the public or confirm or deny an event, then you can avoid calls from dozens of media outlets hounding you in the short term. It'll give you breathing room to gather the facts on the investigation before responding to follow-up questions or releasing more details. We know the scanner chatter is often wrong, but often we can't afford not to chase a story unless the police confirm that it's wrong.

A tweet is a starting point. It can be a great way to immediately alert a lot of people to a major news issue (a high-profile arrest) or a public safety or infrastructure concern (tunnel closing, fire or tornado). But there needs to be....

2. Interaction. The nature of the internet has changed communication. It is not a one-way platform. For it to have any relevance, you have to interact.

People will come to you looking for answers. if you don't provide them, lots of other people on the internet will try to fill in the gaps, often with misinformation. A tweet from a passerby that says something like, "I drove by a fire on Main St., and it looks like a plane hit a house. It's carnage everywhere." could have just been a small kitchen fire that sent lots of smoke into a residential street. There is no replacement for an investigation from the authorities.

This will inevitably raise a number of questions in departments large and small:Â Who is in charge of the Twitter feed? Who is empowered to post on it? Is there a policy for replying to tweets or Facebook comments?Â It can be time consuming to keep up to date. But a social media presence isn't particularly useful as simply an archive of static press releases. (As I learned at the event, the <a href="http://www.iacpsocialmedia.org/" target="_blank">International Association of Chiefs of Police Center on Social Media</a> has drafted <a href="http://www.iacpsocialmedia.org/GettingStarted/PolicyDevelopment.aspx" target="_blank">a model policy</a> for law enforcement agencies on how to adopt social media tools).

Being on the internet has to be faster than telling reporters that they have to wait three days to talk to the designated PIO about a homicide (which we hear far more often than one would expect). And posting a single statement online isn't sufficient. It's a good place to start so we know what kind of story we're dealing with, but we need to be able to follow up. We need to be able to ask questions to clarify statements and probe for more detail. You don't have to answer all of the questions, but we need to be able to ask them.

We don't want to ever have to attribute information to an agency's website or Twitter feed. We use these as planning tools. Then we want to confirm the information with a real person in the department to make sure we got it right.

And the police can use these social media platforms to their advantage.Â The LAPD used Twitter to seek information in a hit and run of a valet at a restaurant, for instance. They later arrested an elderly man in the case, although it's not clear if the tip that led to his arrest came from a Twitter user.

The <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/njsp" target="_blank">NJ State Police</a> has used Twitter to dispel rumors and bad information from scanner reports about a plane crash in South Jersey or SEALs training in the Delaware River. They've also used it to get out initial information on fatal accidents and crimes before being bombarded by reporters.

3. The internet is just a tool. If your department or PIO refuses to share public information with the public, then there's no point in being online. You have to have information that people want for it to be worthwhile. Posting about park closures or issues of minor significance are not good enough. Users on social media, particularly Twitter and Facebook are voracious news consumers. They want substance and lots of it. If you're not answering phone calls from reporters who need information, there's no reason you'd do it online.

The benefit of encouraging an air of transparency in your department however is that it can help demystify the process of police work and humanize law enforcement officers.

4. Facebook and Twitter can also be investigative tools. When we background a subject of a story, a crime or otherwise, these sites are among theÂ first things we look at.

In several cases in New Jersey lately, it's been a key component of criminal charges against young people. In the <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/09/hold_new_rutgers_post.html" target="_new">Tyler Clementi case</a>, his former roommate is charged with trying to doctor his Twitter account to remove incriminating information. In the case of a group of Old Bridge teens accused of beating a man to death, they allegedly <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/11/teens_bragged_about_beating_of.html" target="_new">held extensive conversations on Facebook</a> about the night in question and the beating.

And it helps us track people down, like the Hoboken woman who shot <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/05/hoboken_womans_iphone_photos_o.html" target="_blank">the amazing picture of the Space Shuttle</a> from the window of her airplane. We found her on Facebook.
----

My talk went well, although it was a bit disconcerting to notice that one of my fellow panelists, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MPLASD" target="_blank">Capt. Mike Parker</a> of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, was looking up <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/resume/" target="_new">my resume</a> on his laptop as I spoke. Even though I post all these things to the whole world on the internet, it's easy to forget sometimes that anyone actually looks at it.

The rest of the day's discussions offered a good opportunity to see some of these sources in a less-heated environment and learn from the other attendees and panelists (including Ted Gest ofÂ <a href="http://reporters.net/cjj/whoweare.html" target="_blank">Criminal Justice Journalists</a> and Nancy Kolb of theÂ <a href="http://www.theiacp.org/" target="_blank">International Association of Chiefs of Police</a>)Â about some of the resources we all have at our fingertips. I found out about <a href="http://www.thecrimereport.org/" target="_blank">The Crime Report</a>, put together by Criminal Justice Journalists and The Center on Media, Crime and Justice. I also heard about IACP's handy directory of <a href="http://www.iacpsocialmedia.org/Directory.aspx" target="_blank">police agencies with a presence on social media</a>.

Probably the best reminder I heard all day though came from one of the other panelists, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CaptainJeffPaul" target="_blank">Capt. Jeff Paul</a>, public information officer for the Morris County Prosecutor's Office. Â He bristled at receiving calls from reporters asking for information, in some cases demanding answers, without ever coming to introduce themselves to him. 

Even with all of this magic from the interwebs to help us communicate faster and easier, there really is no replacement for building a personal relationship, face-to-face, with a police source, before you're on deadline in the middle of a catastrophe.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have a job opening up on our CAR team here at The Star-Ledger.

I'm not even going to try to compete with Matt Doig's <a href="http://motherjones.tumblr.com/post/4046557808/the-best-journalism-job-want-ad-ever-ever" target="_blank">hilarious</a> and <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/romenesko/124910/im-just-mystified-that-this-little-job-post-has-resonated-with-so-many-people-in-the-business/" target="_blank">infamous</a> job post, but I will preface this by saying the Ledger is a very good place to work.

We've got great journalists here who make a habit of exposing the mind-boggling arrogance, greed, incompetence and corruption of the Garden State's public officials. One of our colleagues just <a href="http://amyellisnutt.com/" target="_blank">won a Pulitzer</a> <span> in feature writing for her investigation of the sinking of a small fishing vessel that killed six men</span>. We're led by top-notch editors who care about writing and about watchdog journalism that gets results. Â My (relatively) new team is starting to do some cool work, and we have an ambitious agenda for the year ahead.

I'm looking for strong candidates <strong><em>soon</em></strong>. Please pass this along to anyone you think might be qualified. Here's the job description:
<blockquote>The Star-Ledger is looking for a journalist to fill an entry-level position on its computer-assisted reporting team. The reporter will be responsible for acquiring and analyzing public records and data to support enterprise stories for print and online. He or she should be comfortable filing public records and freedom of information requests with agencies at the local, state and federal levels. The reporter will also contribute to the redesign and maintenance of NJ By The Numbers, our home for databases and statistics vital to New Jersey readers.

Qualifications: A background in local or investigative reporting for a daily news outlet and an affinity for math, web development and programming. Ability to identify and mine public databases for storiesÂ large and small and to build and manage relational databases. Experience displaying data graphically in print and online to engage readers.

Proficiency with Microsoft Excel and Access, SQL, HTML and CSS, ESRI ArcView and Google Maps. Bonus points for candidates who have experience or interest in scraping, scripting, frameworks (Django, Rails, ASP.Net) or statistical analysis with SPSS, SAS or R.</blockquote>
If you're interested, send me a cover letter, resume and clips to my work email, tmeagher(at)starledger(dot)com.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Checklist to bulletproof your data work</title>
<link>http://blog.tommeagher.com/2012/06/checklist/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Updated on 6/23</strong>: I've included, marked by an asterisk, several fantastic checklist suggestions offered by David Donald at the <a href="http://www.ire.org/blog/2012-ire-conference-blog/" target="_blank">IRE '12 conference</a> in Boston.</em>

<hr />Much like surgeons, journalists who work with data can always use help ensuring they're getting things right.  I compiled this checklist of questions I ask myself whenever I work with a data set. It's evolved into a tool that The Star-Ledger data team uses on every story we write.
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Where did the data come from?</li>
	<li>Who created it? Is this the best source for this data? What was the methodology behind its collection?</li>
	<li>What documentation came with it?</li>
	<li>Did you read the documentation?</li>
	<li>Is there a record layout or data dictionary?</li>
	<li>Did you save an original copy of the database if you need to retrace your steps?</li>
	<li>Are your field headings accurate? Do you have the columns labeled correctly?</li>
	<li>Are you looking at the correct tab? Is there additional data in other tabs in the worksheet?</li>
	<li>How many records are in your table or database? How many should be there? Are there any missing? Too many? Any chance you maxed out the number of fields the software can handle?</li>
	<li>Are there duplicates in the records?*</li>
	<li>Examine each column of data one at a time. Is it formatted in the appropriate manner? Are there any gaps in the column? Are any data missing?</li>
	<li>Have names and entities been cleaned and standardized?*</li>
	<li>Check the aggregation. How was it done?*</li>
	<li>When joining tables, are you certain the join worked? How many records are there now? Too many? Not enough?</li>
	<li>When pasting tables with common columns side-by-side in Excel, do they line up? Any chance two records might be switched?</li>
	<li>What calculation are you trying to do? Are you using the appropriate formula or function for this task?</li>
	<li>Do your cell/column references in functions point to the right places? Are any columns transposed? Can you trace the formula's path? Have you pasted the correct formula all the way down the column to the bottom of the table?</li>
	<li>When sorting, did you sort the entire table together and not omit any columns?</li>
	<li>When pasting, is it a good idea to Paste Special&gt;Values to strip out any pesky underlying formulas that may become misdirected?</li>
	<li>When moving columns, were there any $ anchors that you pasted that now point to the wrong column or row of data and throw off your calculations?</li>
	<li>Does your calculation make sense?</li>
	<li>Are you looking at outliers or values in the middle of the pack?*</li>
	<li>Is there an expert--either an agency data guru or academic--who has  vetted your process or calculations?</li>
	<li>Have you verified your records against the original records or a  sample thereof?*</li>
	<li>Have you spot-checked individual records to ensure the numbers match up? Did you ask a colleague to assist by reading off numbers to be CQ'd?</li>
	<li>Have you asked an uninvolved colleague to look at your process, review the numbers and poke holes in the methodology?</li>
	<li>Can you reproduce your calculations from the beginning or explain step-by-step how you arrived at your conclusion?</li>
	<li>What numbers are you using in the story? Have you circled them and reviewed them in the database? Is the description of the numbers accurate? Does it omit any pertinent details that might mislead an unwary reader?</li>
	<li>Are the numbers here based on counting, estimates, projections or guesses?*</li>
	<li>Are there any graphics with the story? Have you checked them? Can you verify every number? Are the introduction and column heads accurate? Are there numbers missing from the graphic that are important to the story?</li>
	<li>Is there a methodology/nerd box to run with the story?*</li>
	<li>How did you get here, and does it make sense?</li>
</ul>

How do you bulletproof your data work? At the 2012 NICAR conference in St. Louis, Tom Johnson and <a href="https://twitter.com/cephillips" target="_new">Cheryl Phillips</a> led a seminar discussing <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=CA060AF0B8AF9A15&amp;id=CA060AF0B8AF9A15!110#cid=CA060AF0B8AF9A15&amp;id=CA060AF0B8AF9A15!199" target="_new">their tips for validating data</a>. I'd really like to hear any advice or ideas you're willing to share. Leave a comment here with your techniques or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ultracasual" target="_new">tweet at me</a>.

<hr /><span style="font-style: italic;">This is a rough walkthrough of the class I'm teaching at the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://ire.org/conferences/ire-2012/" target="_blank">2012 IRE conference</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> in Boston on how to use Google Refine to clean data. If you'd like to see them, these are the slides from the session, </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://bit.ly/ire12refineslides" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/ire12refineslides</a><span style="font-style: italic;">. Please forgive the weird line returns of WordPress. If you hit any hiccups or have suggestions for improvement, please leave a comment or mention me on Twitter </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.twitter.com/ultracasual" target="_blank">@ultracasual</a><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>
<h2>You're faced with a dilemma that's fairly common in many newsrooms.</h2>
Say, for example, a series of accidents kills a number of children crossing busy streets near you. Now, you want to know the deadliest roads or intersections in your area (this is not the dilemma, just wait for it). <img class="alignright" style="float: right; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Barney Fife" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f0bvyZMrZ9k/TTjrIgdvMaI/AAAAAAAAGFE/UppLYR8YaJw/s1600/barney-fife.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="272" />
<div>We always say in the news business to check it out, and we shouldn't trust anecdote and the frailty of human memory. Â So where do you go?</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span>Does this guy, right, look like he has an encyclopedic knowledge of every fatal accident in your five-county </span>coverage area?</div>
<div>File a public records request and get the data. It should have the answer you need, right? You pick up your CD with the data, or if you're really lucky, the state police will have a file you can download from their website. You expect to get a tidy Excel spreadsheet with very orderly numbers on it. Everything will be geocoded, and you'll just need to do one quick pivot table or one quick group-by query and drop it into <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/" target="_blank">Fusion Tables</a> and BAM! you're done with your story. It writes itself, right?</div>
</div>
</div>
<img class="alignnone" title="Google Earth for Pirates" src="http://www.cartoonstock.com/newscartoons/cartoonists/mbc/lowres/mbcn1960l.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="280" />

You laugh, but this is what I spent years believing, and every time I was--and continue to be--flabbergasted by the sloppiness of the public data I get my hands on.

When I worked on the dangerous intersections story, I got something that looked like this:
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-954 aligncenter" title="refine" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/refine.jpg" alt="refine" width="426" height="248" /></p>

<div>

(This is a dramatization)

As David Donald said in his CAR panel yesterday, cleaning is the longest and hardest part of the data process. Assume any data you get is dirty and full of holes.

Government data is hardly unique in this respect, but it is our bread and butter, and frankly we should expect better from the government, so I'll pick on it today.</div>
<h2><span>Why is so much public data such a mess?</span></h2>
<div>1. Much like journalists, government agencies are not nearly as good with numbers as they ought to be.

<span>2. When databases exist, they are often built on things never intended to be turned into relational data, like hand-written accident reports.</span>

<span>3. Many agencies seem to subscribe to the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem" target="_blank"> infinite monkey theorem</a>.</span></div>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.demandstudiossucks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/monkey-typewriter-1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="225" /></div>
<div>
<div>For anyone unfamiliar with it, the infinite monkey theorem more or less says that given an infinite amount of time and an infinite number of monkeys with typewriters, eventually the monkeys will write the complete works of Shakespeare or "A Tale of Two Cities."</div>
<div>
<div><span>When you work with a lot of public data, this is what feels like. Occasionally there's something correct, but before you find it, you have to wade through what seems like a near-infinite number of errors. </span><span><span> I'm not suggesting that government employees are primates, but I am pretty certain that they're outsourcing their data entry to monkeys... and it gets worse.</span></span></div>
<div><span>
</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<div><span>Because these monkeys are not geniuses.</span></div>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img class="aligncenter" title="Dr. Zaius" src="http://images.wikia.com/planetoftheapes/images/a/a3/Zaius_1.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="180" /></p>

<div>
<div>They are enemies of good data.</div>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img class="aligncenter" title="Flying monkey with the Wicked Witch of the West" src="http://pwwwblog.ibeatyou.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/the-wizard-of-oz-monkey-2.jpg" alt="" width="221" height="230" /></p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div>These monkeys are mean, and they hate puppies and clean data (and water). To be fair, in my completely unscientific survey, the data has gotten better in the past decade, but it's not where it should be.</div>
<div>Every data entry mistake possible will be made. Often you fill find new mistakes that you never, ever would have considered or imagined in your wildest dreams.</div>
<div>

<span>These clerical errors will make your life miserable. You can either welcome our new monkey overlords or you can arm yourself.</span></div>
<h2>The old tools</h2>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Excel: filters, pivot tables, string functions</li>
	<li>Access: Group by queries</li>
	<li>Notepad++: Regular expressions</li>
	<li>Scripting language for automated, repetitive cleaning</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>With these, the cleaning of the database could take days or weeks or longer.</div>
<div>Now you can do it with Google Refine in a few hours or less.</div>
<img class="alignright" title="Google Refine" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Google-refine-logo.svg/631px-Google-refine-logo.svg.png" alt="" width="95" height="90" />
<div>It can take that crap and turn it into a diamond.</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<h2>What is Refine good at?</h2>
<div>- Transforming data, either on individual cells or whole columns at a time</div>
<div>

- Clustering data to find similar values that repeat for exploration and cleaning

<span>- And many, many other tasks.</span></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Refine does a lot of really amazing things, and this class will give you just a tiny taste. It can help high-level programmers with repetitive tasks, and it has its own expression language for accessing and scrubbing data.Â But it is also a great tool for the less technical set. If you're comfortable with Microsoft Excel, you should be right at home with Refine. You don't have to be a comp sci PhD to love it.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">The two big areas we're going to concentrate on today are clustering data and transforming it</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">So let's get started.Â Here are instructions<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/InstallationInstructions" target="_blank"> to install Refine</a> on your computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We'll start with a dataset of lottery winners from New Jersey. Say you want to know what areas spend the most on lottery tickets but win the least.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Download <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lotterywinners.csv" target="_blank">the lottery dataset here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Refine runs through your web browser, but don't worry, it works offline as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can import a table file in many formats, either from your computer, from Google Docs or from a URL for a file on the web. Once you have Refine running, click "Create Project."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You'll see a preview of what the data looks like. When you pull in the CSV of lottery data, make sure to uncheck the "Parse cell data..." option.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-953 aligncenter" title="importcsv" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/importcsv.jpg" alt="importcsv" width="551" height="520" /></p>

<div style="text-align: left;">

New Jersey zip codes start with zero. If Refine guesses that column is a number, it will drop the leading zero, so unchecking the option will preserve the zips as text.

With this data, we're going to use Refine to clean up the W_TOWN column to standardize the names of municipalities. But we never want to work with the raw data, so let's copy the column that we'll actually transform into something usable. So click on the arrow at the top of the W_TOWN column and choose the Edit Column&gt;Add column based on this column option.

Enter a name for the new column. We'll use "TOWN." Original, I know.</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951" title="copycolumn" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/copycolumn.jpg" alt="copycolumn" width="512" height="323" /></p>

<div style="text-align: left;">Now, initially Refine will only display 10 rows, but there are 3,100 in this dataset, so let's look at a for more. Click the number 50 next to "Show as" to see more.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">In Excel, one of the first things you'd do with a dataset is sort it. So click on the arrow at the top of the TOWN column and choose "Sort" from the options. Now, Â you can filter out just a few records. Click on the arrow and choose "Text Filter" from the options. You'll see a box pop up in the left column. Type in Atlantic and see how it plucks out only the towns with "Atlantic" in the name: Atlantic City, Atlantic Highlands, Atlantic High and West Atlantic City. As you might guess, not all of these are real towns.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Let's lose the filter. Click on the X in the upper left corner of the filter box. Now, we're going to add a Facet&gt; Text facet. Dan Nguyen atÂ ProPublica calls Refine's faceting "the better way to filter." He's totally right.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">The facet will create a box in the left column with the total number of choices and a list of all the possible choices in this column and the number of each. You'll see there are 608 options. At the top is "ABERDEEN" with 3 occurrences. Scroll to the bottom and click on "Facet by choice counts." This will create another box that will let you display only the choices that occur a certain number of times. It shows the range of values in a column and helps you to spot anomalies or outliers. For instance, if you move the boundaries to only show the choices with between 120 and 140 uses, you'll only see "JERSEY CITY" and "NEWARK" rows. Close the "Facet by choice counts" box.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Scroll through the text facet box a little ways into the Bs. See the option for "BELEE MEAD"? It has one occurrence. Notice that two lines later appears "BELLE MEAD," the actual name of the town. If you hover over "BELEE MEAD," you will see the option to "edit" appear to the right. Click on that and then fix the spelling of the name in the box that appears. Notice that the choice count drops to 607.</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-952 aligncenter" title="facet" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/facet.jpg" alt="facet" width="538" height="476" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div style="text-align: left;">Let's look at another way to clean data. Scroll down a few more lines. Notice that there are two lines in a row for "BERKELEY HEIGHTS." They're spelled the same, so why are they listed separately? Because one of them has an extra space at the end of it that screws up the grouping. This is the kind of thing that back in the bad old days would make you throw your PC out the window two weeks into a data project. Instead, let's get rid of all the extra, invisible spaces. Click at the top of the TOWN column, edit cells&gt; common transforms&gt; Trim leading and trailing whitespace. Notice again how the choice count dropped. We're down to 573 town names now. We're getting there.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">So you could spend hours scrolling through and eyeballing similar names and editing them by hand using these methods, or we could unleash the real power of Refine: clustering.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Click on the "Cluster" button in the facet box. Click it and you'll see something like this. The default method is "key collision." That should only show a couple of options. Try changing it to "nearest neighbor." I can't exactly explain the algorithm behind it, but it's obvious that it finds town names with similar names that should probably have the same name. You see similar sets like "POMPTON LAKES" and "POMPTON LAKE" or "E. ORANGE," "E ORANGE" and "E.ORANGE." Click the "merge" button next to each grouping and type the name you want them all to be changed to in the "New Cell Value" column and hit the "Merge selected and recluster" button at the bottom. You've just cleaned those messy columns to a single value.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949" title="cluster" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/cluster.jpg" alt="cluster" width="585" height="405" /></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Scroll through the list, reclustering and editing whole chunks at a time. This is a huge time saver. When you're done with the "nearest neighbor" clusters, experiment with "key collision" and see if it picks up any other similar names.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, keep in mind that to get this right, you'll have to do some additional reporting. You'll need to be certain that "NORTH BRUNSWICK" and "NPRTH BRUNSWICK" are indeed the same place and not separate values as they came to you. If you're confident in your reporting, Refine makes the data cleaning easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you're satisfied that you're done, click on "Export" on the upper right corner. You can output the file as html, TSV, CSV, Excel or any number of formats. Pull it into your favorite spreadsheet program and run your analysis. Then run it all again to make sure you got it right. To be certain, start from scratch and triple-check it.</p>

<hr />
<div style="text-align: left;">As cool as this is, Refine has a few more tricks for the beginner. Let's look at this file ofÂ <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nj-hospital-2012.xls " target="_blank">NJ hospital report cards</a>.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Create a new project and import it into Refine.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Anything look weird? How about that first column. Seems like itÂ includes information we'd probably want to split into several columns.Â In Excel you'd do this with a series of nested functions. In Refine, we can do it with a single click. At the top of the "Hospital" column, choose the drop-down menu and Edit column&gt;Split into several columns...</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">When the wizard menu pops up, choose Â a semicolon as the separator and uncheck "remove this column," because we always want to be compare against our original data, right?</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-955 aligncenter" title="splitcolumns" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/splitcolumns.jpg" alt="splitcolumns" width="498" height="324" /></p>

<div style="text-align: left;">So this looks better, with the name, street, town, state and zip code in separate columns. But something isn't quite right. What about the zip code? Why is it only four digits? Oh yeah, New Jersey zip codes start with zeroes. Refine assumed that column was an integer and lopped off the zero at the front.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Another great feature of Refine is that it logs everything you do with the dataset. When you make a mistake or you want track back through your work, click on the "Undo/Redo" tab at the top of the left column and you can tiptoe back through your process.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">

Look at the list and click on the item at the top, "0. Create project" to jump back to that step.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958" title="undo" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/undo.jpg" alt="undo" width="451" height="396" />

Now, redo the "Split into several columns..." step and this time uncheck "Guess cell type" to preserve the zips as text.

Be sure to make note of the undo option at the top of the screen. You can move a single step back at any time by clicking on this, much like the undo prompt that appears in Gmail after you archive or delete a message.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">

Finally, notice that the names of the hospital are inconsistent.Â Some are all uppercase. Others are only upper-cased. Let's standardize them.

Click on the arrow at the top of the Hospital column and choose Edit cells&gt; Common transforms &gt; To titlecase.</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-957 aligncenter" title="titlecase" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/titlecase.jpg" alt="titlecase" width="654" height="434" /></p>

Voila. A cleaned dataset. You're welcome.

<hr />Let's try one last dataset, this one looking at contributions from <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nassau_police_union_contribs.xls" target="_blank">Nassau County, N.Y. police unions</a> to political candidates.

Import the data into Refine and let's start by trying to clean up the town names.

Add a text facet to the City column. Click Edit cells&gt; Common transforms&gt; trim leading and trailing whitespace
<div style="text-align: left;">

See the count change from 240 to 238.

Now, let's cluster the city names to see if we can consolidate any entries.</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950" title="copcluster" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/copcluster.jpg" alt="copcluster" width="587" height="271" /></p>

<div style="text-align: left;">How do you see the count change in the city column?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Now, let's turn our attention to the Name column. For this exercise, let's start by adding a filter on the city and just looking at "Albany." You can also do this by clicking on Albany in the text facet box.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Keep in mind Â that any changes we make from here on out will only affect the "Albany" subset of the data until we clear this filter (or facet). Now, add a text facet to the "Name" column. Browse the first few entries. Notice there are a lot of very, very similar names here.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">For the sake of argument, let's say we're interested in looking at how much Sen. Joe Bruno got from Nassau police groups. There appear to be 10 groups here with similar names receiving donations for Bruno. Seems like a good chance that many of these are the same organization. For the sake of argument, let's say your reporting shows that yes, these are the same group and we want them to all have the same name for our analysis. Hover your cursor over each one and when the option to "include" appears on the right, click it. Once you've "included" them all, click the cluster button.</div>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956" title="subfacet" src="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/subfacet.jpg" alt="subfacet" width="341" height="486" />
<div style="text-align: left;">This will attempt to cluster the choices just in this selection to offer suggestions on names that could b the same. Change the method to "nearest neighbor" and the distance function to "PPM." If you merge all of the offered suggestions under the same name, it will condense six of the 10 choices into one name. Then you can merge and re-cluster. Once you clean up all the suggestions, you can browse the data in the facet one last time and clean up any stragglers individually as needed. Believe it or not, Refine has just saved you a massive amount of time and energy.</div>
<h2>What did we learn here today?</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">Refine is a huge time saver and allows you to do commonly tedious data cleaning tasks with a few clicks of the mouse. We saw how to:
- Import and export data.
- Copy and edit columns, trimming whitespaces or changing the capitalization.
- Use facets to filter and edit data
- Cluster a column to standardize spellings and entries.
<p dir="ltr">This has been a whirlwind sprint through this program, but hopefully it's given you a taste of what it can do.</p>

<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<div style="text-align: left;">In an ideal world, we'd get all of our data handed to us perfectly clean in easy to access, user-friendly, real time feeds that make for simple analysis and display.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">But until then, we're going to have to wrestle with the murky and messy datasets produced by those infinite monkeys making an infinite number of mistakes. Use Refine as your new big gun and never give up the fight.</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">And remember, if you let the monkeys who enter data into government spreadsheets win, this is where it will lead.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone" title="Spoiler alert" src="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/toddessig/files/2011/08/planetoftheapesending.jpg" alt="" width="495" height="361" /></p>

They'll make a monkey out of you too.

<title>Bolstering transparency in our reporting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em></em>

<em>Back at the Herald News, several of the editors and reporters wrote a regular series of columns for the newsroom called "Best Practices." In digging through my archives, I've found several that are timeless that I will gradually repost. This first one was written by <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2008/02/maslow-mourned/" target="_self">Jonathan Maslow</a>, and his tips for being transparent in our reporting and writing continue to ring true.</em>

Our credibility as journalists and as a newspaper is the most important equity we have in the marketplace of ideas. The more readers trust us, the better our performance. We have to earn that trust every single day. One of the most important ways to do this is leveling with our readers: telling them what we know, how we know it, what we don't know, why we don't know it and what's what. In practice this entails the highest degree of transparency possible in our publication.Work toward greater transparency:

1) Don't use hearsay. Don't describe things you didn't see, but rather attribute it to a firsthand witness and tell the reader who that witness was. If you are writing about a public meeting you did not attend, be aware that readers must not be given a false impression. You don't need to say you weren't there. But you can't report things as if you were there.

2) Don't just use the boilerplate "sources said," but give the reader as much information as you can without breaching trust, for example: "two sources in the AG's office familiar with the case," or "a high official in the department who asked her name not be used because she feared political retribution."

3) Don't just use the cliche "the mayor could not be reached for comment." Use instead: "the mayor did not return repeated phone calls for comment over a three-day period, although City Hall said he was not on vacation or out of town on business."

4) As you know, we sometimes have problems getting information from police on weekends. Don't just let this go with "police did not release information." Tell the readers, e.g., "Sgt. Troy Anthony said he could not release any information about the incident, because Mayor Sammy Torres, who is also acting public safety director, has told the police department that all news releases must go through his office. The mayor did not return five phone calls Sunday."

Transparency is a habit, a muscle. Flex it and it gets stronger. And your work gets more accurate, better, more useful to readers.

<title>Waking from an election results nightmare</title>
<link>http://blog.tommeagher.com/2012/06/waking-from-the-election-results-nightmare/</link>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes, especially after a particularly trying election night, it starts to feel like we may be suffering from post-polls PTSD.

For the past year and a half, we've been experimenting at The Star-Ledger with ways to improve how we report election results online and in print. In many elections, we'll have hundreds of races spread across a dozen counties. And none of the officials overseeing those elections provides a useful electronic feed of results.

We've tried off-the-shelf products to input election data into tables with disastrous, near-comical results. Without a single developer in our newsroom, we've cobbled together solutions and written hundreds of lines of code to reverse engineer our hand-collected data and take it from our website into our print pagination system. For something that's over in just a few hours, we invest an incredible amount of time and effort into getting it right, often without being really satisfied with the product.

All of that struggle has led us here, to our proposal for the Knight Foundation's <a href="http://www.newschallenge.org" target="_blank">News Innovation Challenge</a> for a <a href="http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25541612650/voter-the-versatile-online-tabulator-for-election" target="_blank">project we're calling VOTER</a>.

VOTER is a browser-based program that will help organizations streamline the collection of election results and create embeddable online graphics that will work on any website, especially the common blogging platforms that power many news operations. It is still very early in the development process, but we're excited about the News Challenge and even more psyched about the possibility that we can turn our trauma into something that will save newsrooms everywhere a whole lot of heartache.

What do you think? We'd love to hear your experiences, both good and bad, from the election nights you've covered. What's worked for you to get results online and what hasn't? Leave a comment here or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ultracasual" target="_blank">tweet at me</a>. And, most importantly, tell us what VOTER will need to do to make it useful for your organization.]]></content:encoded>

I conducted the analysis of Census data for this story on median incomes, and I used the <a href="http://fusion-tables-api-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/FusionTablesLayerWizard/src/index.html" target="_new">Fusion Tables Layer builder</a> to create the map. On this project, I was excited to figure out how to position the key inside the map frame.

At the Star-Ledger, I used ProPublica's <a href="http://propublica.github.com/timeline-setter/" target="_new">TimelineSetter</a> tool to pull together photos, video and documents to create this interactive element for our New Jersey Rock &amp; Pop Hall of Fame special section. More recently, I've used <a title="Timeline.js" href="http://timeline.verite.co/" target="_blank">Timeline.js</a> to create timelines of video clips during the presidential debates and <a href="https://github.com/MinnPost/jquery-vertical-timeline" target="_blank">MinnPost's fork</a> of WNYC's <a href="https://github.com/balancemedia/Timeline" target="_blank">vertical timeline</a> for a story ahead of <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/samesexmarriage/ci_22850513" target="_blank">Supreme Court arguments</a> on gay marriage cases.

Using the LA Times' <a href="https://github.com/datadesk/latimes-table-stacker/" target="_new">Table Stacker</a>, I took Census data that I had analyzed for New Jersey towns and created the searchable table. I built the map using Google Fusion Tables and embedded it in the html that Table Stacker baked out.

In addition to producing interactives for news events, I have also built a number of applications in Python for personal projects. Using the <a title="Flask" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">Flask microframework</a>, I <a title="Carboy code" href="https://github.com/tommeagher/Carboy" target="_blank">made a tumbleblog</a> called <a href="http://carboy.tommeagher.com">Carboy</a> to chronicle the beer I brew at home. I also made a Flask <a href="http://ideas.tommeagher.com">app to log ideas</a> <a title="Alva code" href="https://github.com/tommeagher/alva" target="_blank">called Alva</a>.

And in the days leading up to this year's Computer-Assisted Reporting conference, I made a Python program to collect and aggregate tweets around an event. The <a title="hashevents" href="https://github.com/tommeagher/hashevents" target="_blank">hashevents scripts</a> powered a simple leaderboard of the <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/nicar13/">most popular URLs shared and the most active Twitter users</a> at #NICAR13.

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems odd in 2012 that in some newsrooms the data journalists don't get the same kind of credit for their work that other reporters receive. I suppose it's understandable, if NICAR-L is any indication, because to some of our colleagues data work is a mysterious and opaque contribution to a story and thus they don't quite know how or when to give us a byline.

This is the policy we used when I was the CAR reporter at the Herald News, and it was heavily modeled (in some parts verbatim) on the one adopted by <a href="https://twitter.com/gebeloffnyt/" target="_new">Rob Gebeloff</a>, then of The Star-Ledger and now at the New York Times. This slightly updated policy also guides us today at The Star-Ledger as we decide when our work merits a byline. It's a good place for newsrooms to start the conversation about the work of their data people.
<ol>
	<li>The data journalist is available every day for assistance, large and small, on daily, breaking and enterprise stories. The reporter is here to help locate data. When another reporter or editor asks for a quick fact here or there (such as a basic Census figure), no credit is necessary. Itâs part of the job.</li>
	<li>Many times, the quick fact search turns into an analysis of data. When this analysis produces âproprietary informationâ that supports a story, the data journalist should receive a tagline on the story. For example, a colleague wants a complete breakdown of Census data for a particular neighborhoodâa task that would require the reporter to assemble the data piecemeal from several tables or sourcesâthis would create proprietary information unique to our news gathering. If this information is even just a few paragraphs of the story, a tagline is appropriate.</li>
	<li>If the data journalist does a significant analysis of data that creates proprietary information that becomes the thesis of a story, he or she will receive a byline.<u><em><strong> Even if the data journalist does not write another word in the published piece, his or her reporting forms the basis of a story and thus warrants a byline.</strong> </em></u> <br>For example, the journalist analyzes a new set of data released by a government agency and finds that homeowners in suburban Passaic County are scooping up flood insurance hand over fist. The reporter assembles the analyzed data and passes it on to the real estate reporter who finds additional sources for quotes and writes the story. The nut graf of the story should say âa Herald News analysis of TK data has foundâ¦â and the data journalist shares the byline with the other reporter.</li>
</ol>

<title>How to get a head count at the parade</title>
<link>http://blog.tommeagher.com/2012/07/crowd-estimates/</link>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This is another in the series of "Best Practices" posts from my archives from the Herald News. This was also written by <a href="http://www.tommeagher.com/2008/02/maslow-mourned/" target="_self">Jonathan Maslow</a>, and offers some solid street reporting tips for counting the crowd at any large public event.
</em>

News reporting often involves telling how many people took part in or attended an event. Sometimes the seating capacity is known, as in the case of a sports stadium. Sometimes an official estimates the crowd size, sometimes the organizers estimate. Sometimes they don't agree. Sometimes no one estimates.

It's a good practice for the reporter to do his or her own estimation in all cases.

For inside events, a quick head count with a qualifying "about" is good. ("about 75 people attended the planning board session.") The tried and true method of estimating crowd size is as follows:
1) make a careful measurement of the area in which the event takes place. Simply put, that's <strong><em>length times width equals square feet</em></strong>. In some cases, it may take a slightly more sophisticated algorithm (the crowd covers the sidewalks on six blocks. Ask officials how long each block is, walk off the width of sidewalk. Multiply).

2) Decide whether it's a dense crowd or a loose crowd. People packed into a subway car, for example, are a dense crowd and occupy 2 square feet per person. A loose crowd, such as a parade of journalists on May Day, has one person per five square feet.

3) Divide the area by the crowd density, and you've got your estimated crowd.
Example: A political rally takes place in the square outside City Hall. You pace it off and find it's 150 feet long and 100 feet wide, or 15,000 square feet. You wade into the crowd to test the density. Some places toward the front are packed, but in the back it's loose. You choose a density in between of one person per three square feet. Divide 15,000 by 3 = 5,000 people.

To recap:
<blockquote>area: 150 x 100 = 15,000
estimate of density: 3 sq. feet/per person
15,000 divided by 3 = 5,000 attendees</blockquote>
If AP is covering an event, check your estimate against theirs, which is based on aerial/satellite photography and should be accurate. If yours and theirs are at great odds, dig in your heels and insist the wire services are an ass.

Note: [Then] Passaic County Sherriff's communications man Bill Maer says the county uses a slight variation:
<blockquote>1) Count how many people are actually in a 10 x 10 foot area (that's 100 square feet).

2) Measure on foot or get a good estimate of the size of the entire area.

3) divide the total area by 100 (the number of 10 by 10 squares)

4) Multiply the result by how many people are in the sample 10 x 10 foot square.</blockquote>
Personally, I think this adds an unnecessary step, but it does make the reckoning of density a bit more accurate and hence, perhaps, the crowd estimate itself.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are few things more frustrating than trying to get a simple spreadsheet from a government agency and being told by a spokesman that the data (say, a table of property tax rates in municipalities that was clearly created in Excel) only exists in a locked PDF format.

For the sake of expediency, you sometimes just have to bite the bullet and try to wrestle the data free from the PDF's clutches so that you can gently guide it into a more useful spreadsheet.

It's not always easy, but here are a few resources to do just that:

Dan Nguyen at <a href="http://www.propublica.org/" target="_new">ProPublica</a> crafted this very helpful and comprehensive <a href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/turning-pdfs-to-text-doc-dollars-guide" target="_new">guide to the various strategies for unlocking data from PDFs</a>.

I've also had some success using <a href="http://www.cometdocs.com/" target="_new">CometDocs</a>, a free site that had a surprisingly high accuracy rate for converting documents on one particularly labor-intensive project.

If you're not afraid of installing a simple command line program, I've also had some luck with PDF2text. Here's a <a href="http://www.ire.org/resourcecenter/nettour/PDFTOTEXT.pdf" target="_new">nice tutorial from IRE</a> (looks like the link may be temporarily broken), as well as a guide to how to <a href="http://ire.org/blog/on-the-road/2010/09/01/quick-fix-to-tame-pdfs/" target="_new">automate the conversions</a> and not be bothered by the pesky command line.

I've heard good things about the commercial software <a href="http://www.docudesk.com/deskunpdf_product_home.shtml" target="_new">DeskUnPDF</a>, but I haven't had an opportunity to use it myself.

When you don't have the time or patience to negotiate with an agency to give you what you want how you want it, give these solutions a try.

If you have other techniques for culling data from PDFs, please share them.

Good luck!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Update: In mid-December, I led two days of training in data journalism techniques for my colleagues at the New Haven Register. On a Thursday evening, I took the Amtrak train home to New Jersey, feeling good about turning a group of journalists on to the power and fun of incorporating data into their reporting. </em>

<em>The next morning, the horrible shooting at Newtown Elementary School threw our world upside-down. Only now, more than two months later, have I been able to take a moment to revisit the rough notes and links I dumped here in December to try to make them a little more useful. </em>

<em>The first class was an overview discussion of "data journalism" and the many and sundry techniques that encompasses. The second class was a hands-on walk-through of Excel and Google Fusion Tables. The handouts and cheatsheets cover nearly all of the tips we discussed. If you have questions, or would like to know more, please leave a comment or send me an email.</em>

</ul>
Letâs do something fun and map the data for a story, using Google's experimental (and free) <a href="http://tables.googlelabs.com/" target="_blank">Fusion Tables</a> program. We're going to download a spreadsheet in the CSV format of the violent crime rates for every town in Connecticut.

Go to <a href="http://www.datahaven.org" target="_blank">DataHaven.org</a> Go to indicators&gt;Public safety&gt;Community safety&gt;Violent crimes&gt; total violent crime rate
Select all towns and hit the submit button. Click "All years" and hit submit again. Now you can download the CSV, which stands for comma-separated values. It's essentially a spreadsheet without any of the fancy highlighting or formatting of Excel. It's a universal format, and when given the option, it's a good idea to get your data in CSV. Because of its simple structure, it's easy for a human to read and just about any computer can understand it.

Now, we have our data, but if we want to visualize it, we need a map to put it on. We can get this map from a SHP (pronounced "shape") file. Â Luckily, in many states, the government or academic institutions often have a clearing house for this kind of geographic data. In Connecticut, you can find it at the U. Conn. library. Point your browser toward <a href="http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/" target="_blank">http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/</a>, then look under the "CT GIS" column and click on the "<a href="http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/connecticut_data.html#boundaries" target="_blank">Boundaries</a>" section.

Grab the "Connecticut Towns" shapefile from 2010. Then you have to convert the file to a format that Fusion Tables can use. Luckily, there is a free website called "<a href="http://shpescape.com/" target="_blank">Shp Escape</a>" that can help. Give it your shp file and log into your Google account and it will automatically transform the file and ship it into your Fusion Tables account. Some times the site can be a little busy, so it may take a few minutes. Be patient.

Now, that you have your map file in Fusion Tables, you need the data you want to visualize. Go to Google Drive, click the "create" button and choose Fusion Table. Choose the "download.csv" file that you got from Data Haven and put this into your Fusion Table. (Notice, Fusion Tables also allows you to import tabular data directly from a Google Spreadsheeet.

Clean up the column headings in the file to make the more meaningful. Now we're going to merge the data file back to the shape file we already uploaded. Under the "File" dropdown menu, choose "Merge." Find your Connecticut Towns shape table. And you have to determine which field to join the tables on. What field is the same in both tables? Notice that the "town" field in the crime table matches the "NAME10" field in the shape file. That's your key to join the tables together. Just be certain that each town name only appears once in that column in each table (in this example, it does).

Once it sends you into Fusion Tables, click the "About this table" link under the File dropdown menu and "edit table information." Update the name of the table, give it a meaningful description, attribution and a link to the original download. This can help you later to retrace your steps and bulletproof your reporting. It will also help others who look at your work and want to see your primary source material. Click on the "Share" button and make the map public.

We have both tables combined together into one, new, merged table. But if you click on the "Map" tab, it probably still doesn't look right. We need to style the representation of the data. While you're on the map tab, go to the "Tools" dropdown and click on "Change Map Styles." This will allow us to choose how we want to color code the towns based on their crime rate. Instead of points, we want to click on "Fill color" under the "Polygons" section. Points would be if we were color-coding pins on individual addresses. Instead, we want to shade an entire town based on its crime rate, thus we want "polygon." For the fill color, let's pick the "buckets" tab, which means we can choose four different colors to represent the range of crime rates in our area. If you want to fancy, you can choose whatever color you want for each bucket. Hit the "save" button. Are all of your towns filled in with a color? (You can ignore the "<a href="http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm" target="_blank">Southwick Jog</a>"). If not, then you probably haven't set the range of values for your crime rate to the include all of them. Adjust the high and low ends of your range until none of your towns are blank. This may take some jiggering.

Play with the bucket sizes and colors of the buckets. What makes sense? Is everything in there?

Click on the title to change the attribution and background info for the merged table. Share the merged table and make it public. Then click Tools&gt; Publish. This gives you the embed code for you to put it in your story.

Once you get the hang of this, you can but producing web-ready interactive maps in 20-30 minutes, a task that would have taken hours or days not all that long ago. This is an awesome tool.

<iframe width="500" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=MAP&amp;q=select+col0%3E%3E1+from+1hJY9IspBzWrEx5csZTISYn_r4JKlbTBIlGZyyyI&amp;h=false&amp;lat=41.620240308269935&amp;lng=-72.47735563281253&amp;z=8&amp;t=1&amp;l=col0%3E%3E1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2"></iframe>

There are a few more things that you can tweak, if you like. You can go to Tools&gt;Change info window layout, to tweak the information that's displayed when you click on a polygon.

And one last tip, you don't always have to upload your own data or map files. You can go to Help&gt;Search Public Tables and browse through all of the data that other Fusion Tables users have uploaded. Of course, as with all reporting, the caveat is to mindful of the source. Always confirm the information and data with other parties. But if you find a good shapefile, you could use it again and again. It's definitely worth exploring.

That's the super fast and dirty introduction to Fusion Tables. Now, go explore it some more on your own. What's your favorite trick in Fusion Tables? Drop me an email, leave a comment or mention me on Twitter and I'll add it here.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[At IRE's <a href="http://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar-2013/" target="_blank">computer-assisted reporting conference</a> this week in Louisville, I am once again teaching a course on using <a href="http://openrefine.org/" target="_blank">OpenRefine</a> to clean data. Although the program has changed names over the last few months, its features are pretty much the same, and it's still an amazingly powerful and free tool for cleaning and standardizing difficult data. If you ever find yourself frustrated with typos, misspellings or any number of other mistakes in the data you get from government agencies, OpenRefine will change your life.

I won't repeat verbatim my Refine tutorial, <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/2012/06/clean-data-is-the-best-weapon-against-the-planet-of-the-apes/">which you can find here</a>, but I will share some of the resources again and point you to a few other tutorials.

First, check out the updatedÂ <a href="http://bit.ly/car13refineslides" target="_blank">slides for my class</a>. If you'd like to follow along with the class, you can download our data for the <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lotterywinners.csv">lottery winners</a>, the <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nj-hospital-2012.xls">hospital report cards</a>, and the <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nassau_police_union_contribs.xls">campaign finance data</a>.

If you're just looking for a good cheat sheet of Refine's key functions, <a href="http://bit.ly/car13refinecheats" target="_blank">try this</a>.

If you thought my class was easy, and you're looking for more help with Refine, I can recommend these tutorials, from Refine creator <a href="http://davidhuynh.net/spaces/nicar2011/tutorial.pdf" target="_blank">David Huynh</a>, developer <a href="http://dannguyen.github.com/NICAR-Google-Refine/" target="_blank">Dan Nguyen</a> and journalism educator <a href="http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/07/05/cleaning-data-using-google-refine-a-quick-guide/" target="_blank">Paul Bradshaw</a>.

What's your favorite use for OpenRefine? Leave a comment here, drop me an email or mention me on Twitter. I'd love to hear what you think.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Learning to commit to version control</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[At this week's <a href="http://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar-2013/">computer-assisted reporting conference</a> in Louisville, IRE has me doing double-duty. In addition to my class on <a href="bit.ly/car13refine" target="_blank">OpenRefine</a>, I'm also teaching a hands-on session on <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>.

This assumes you've already <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">downloaded git</a> and created an account on Github. I use the command line, although if you master that, the GUI clients will be a piece of cake.

I've somehow,Â inadvertentlyÂ become a bit of a Git evangelist, not out of any mastery, but mostly because of my convert's zeal for version control. Â And the one-two punch of git and Github have changed the way I think about my job, web development and sharing knowledge. Here's a quick run-through of the class. If you're a visual learner, the slides are here:Â <span><a href="http://bit.ly/car13gitslides" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/car13gitslides</a></span>
<h2>What is git?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control_system" target="_blank">distributed version control system</a> (If this doesn't mean anything to you, don't sweat it. It's mostly for the nerds)</li>
	<li>a command line utility to track changes to a file and to share those changes with others.</li>
	<li>good for any kind of text - stories, csv, html, .js, .py, .rb.</li>
	<li>not so great with images, audio, video</li>
</ul>
<h2>What does git do?</h2>
<span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932">In a broad oversimplification, it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff" target="_blank">diff</a> to compare every addition and subtraction in your code and shows you how your files evolve.</span>

It lets you take snapshots of your code and roll through them over time (or back in time) as needed to follow how a file changes from save to save to save. And you can have several authors of a file branch off their own versions to edit and then later merge them all back together into one master file.

<img class="alignnone" title="Newsdiff" src="http://www.clasesdeperiodismo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Newsdiff-mubarak.png" alt="" width="703" height="308" />
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
There's a lot of things going on behind the curtain in git, that you can figure out eventually, but don't worry about it here. For right now, basically you only need to really know six commands.

The first thing you want to know is
<pre>git status</pre>
This will orient you to where you are, what files have changed and whether you've saved your snapshot of your project (which we'll soon start calling a "commit"). This is your friend.

Where you work and where you edit your code is the working directory. When you're ready to take a snapshot of your code, you "add" your file to the staging area.
<pre>git add foo.py</pre>
<img class="alignleft" title="Git diagram" src="http://codingdomain.com/git/partial-commits/git-staging-area.png" alt="" width="336" height="194" />

After you've made all the changes you want, and you've "added" all of your updated files to the staging area, it's time to make a commit. And with each commit, you want to add a short message describing what the changes are.
<pre>git commit -m "finally debugged my own idiocy. maybe..."</pre>
Now all of your updates are saved in your file respository, and if you want to, you can your snapshot is made. You could very easily stop here and just keep the audit trail on your machine. But the other half of this happy marriage is <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>.
<h2><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932">
What is Github?</span></h2>
<span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"><img class="alignright" title="Github" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo-transparent.png" alt="" width="461" height="461" /><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932">Github is a social coding site, and it's a hosted remote repository.
</span></span>

<span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932">It lets you back up all of your code online (for free if it's open source), and it lets you see how other developers do it and learn from their work. </span></span>

<span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932">Here's how you do it: </span></span>
<pre>git push -u origin master</pre>
<span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4894332503899932">You "push" your code from the "master" branch that's on your machine to your remote repository on Github, which we call "origin." (This may have already been configured for you if you cloned your repo from github. Otherwise, you would have to </span></span>
<pre>git remote add origin git@github.com:tommeagher/myrepo.git</pre>
)

One of the many great things about Github is that you can see the diff in your files without the Matrix hypnosis of command line.

The last couple commands I'll tell you are how you get your commits from the remote repository on Github back on your machine.

You can use
<pre> git fetch origin</pre>
to gather the updated files from your remote "origin" repository. Now you want to "merge" the changes from the master branch on your remote "origin" repository into your master branch on your machine.
<pre>git merge origin/master</pre>
Now your files are updated from the remote repository. Now keep coding.

If you want more, you can visit the <a href="http://www.github.com/tommeagher/gitintro">repo for this class</a>, where I have a cheat sheet for the most common basic uses and commands and more in-depth tutorials.

This really just deals with the basics. We haven't even had a chance to talk about <a href="http://githowto.com/resolving_conflicts">merge problems</a>, <a href="http://gitref.org/branching/">branching</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">forking </a>or <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/ch03.html">cloning</a>, but you know how to Google, so you can figure it out. Fork my repo, improve the cheat sheet and send me a pull request.

What's your favorite tip or cheat in git? Leave me a comment. I'd love to read it.]]></content:encoded>

<title>What I learned organizing a hackathon</title>
<link>http://blog.tommeagher.com/2013/04/organizing-my-first-hackathon/</link>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[It all started in September, at the <a href="http://ona12.journalists.org/" target="_blank">Online News Association</a>'s conference in San Francisco. I crashed the <a href="http://wjchat.webjournalist.org/" target="_blank">#wjchat</a> party and ended up meeting the infamous <a href="http://www.debragalant.com/" target="_blank">Debbie Galant</a>, the force of nature behind <a href="http://www.baristanet.com/" target="_blank">Baristanet</a> who was just starting the <a href="http://njnewscommons.org/" target="_blank">NJ News Commons</a>. We talked about journalism in Jersey. I floated the idea of a news hackathon, and she was intrigued.

Fast forward through a hurricane, an election, months of planning and promotion, and <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/03/11/rounding-up-our-hack-weekend/" target="_blank">24 hours of hacking</a>. I sat in a lecture hall at Montclair State University listening in awe to 11 teams of journalists and programmers pitch their projects to change news in New Jersey.

[Of course, I'm glossing over many logistical details here. I'll just say that we could not have pulled it off without the generosity and advice of our <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/sponsors-2/" target="_blank">sponsors and partners</a>, especially the News Commons and <a href="http://www.montclair.edu/arts/school-of-communication-and-media/" target="_blank">the university</a>, <a href="http://www.mozillaopennews.org/" target="_blank">Knight-Mozilla OpenNews</a>, <a href="http://cartodb.com/" target="_blank">CartoDB</a>, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/" target="_blank">O'Reilly</a>, <a href="http://www.nj.com/" target="_blank">The Star-Ledger</a>, <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/" target="_blank">The Record</a>, <a href="http://www.patch.com/" target="_blank">Patch</a>, <a href="http://echolocation.com/" target="_blank">Echo</a> and many others.]

I couldn't believe we pulled it off. There's no way I could have imagined in September how much I'd learn about building community, blending cultures and sowing the seeds for us to think about news and data in new ways. Among those lessons:
<ul>
	<li>It was a serious miscalculation on my part to try to start at 9 a.m. on a Saturday. Neither journalists nor developers are early risers. As we waited for folks to drift in, we had to start late and rush some of <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/03/11/rounding-up-our-hack-weekend/" target="_blank">the presentations</a>.</li>
	<li>One of the biggest challenges was trying to manage people's expectations of what they'd get out of giving up a weekend to stare at a computer screen on a college campus. Some people wanted to learn to code. Others wanted nerds to help them with their next big project. A few, I imagine, wanted to network for a job. We wanted everyone to feel like she or he could be a part of this experience and could offer something, no matter previous experience or skill level. For some newsroom denizens whose only exposure to developers was their much maligned IT staff, this was a revolutionary idea. They have been trained to treat technologists like a deli counter: Order up whatever newfangled internet thing you need and wait for it to show up. My hope was at the end of the hackathon, our reporters and developers could start to imagine how they can work together. I think on that front we succeeded.</li>
	<li>We may have overloaded the schedule with speakers, and our talks were geared too heavily toward journalists. Some of the participants would have liked more discussion of the process of creating news apps rather than the concepts of data journalism and news app thinking. Others wanted less yakking and more hacking.</li>
	<li>It's just as important for us to bring programmers to the news world as it is to introduce journalists to the development process. We succeeded on the latter, but we need to do more for the former. We could have used speakers from the tech world who would have lured more programmers.</li>
	<li>I wish we had more diversity in <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/speakers/" target="_blank">our roster of speakers</a>. I was thrilled to have Emily Bell as <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/judges/" target="_blank">one of our judges</a>.Â A majority of the folks on our planning committee were women, as were many of our participants. But I think we erred in not having more women presenters, giving a false impression of the state of news development and the programming world as a whole.</li>
	<li>We just didn't have enough developers. We needed to have more than one on each team, preferably someone with backend skills and someone else with frontend skills. Some of the teams had one developer and four journalists. That just didn't work.</li>
	<li>We found some teams didn't need more than one or two journalists, even those with significant computer-assisted reporting skills. Some of the CAR veterans had a hard time translating their expertise in analyzing data to the idea of developing a reusable application.</li>
	<li>To my surprise, many of the programmers were not really familiar <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/2013/03/learning-to-commit-to-version-control/" target="_blank">with version control or git</a>. Only Sunday morning, as the deadline loomed, did some teams ask about how to use Github, leaving me to run around and teach people. Some teams also didn't have server space to host a demo site, something I assumed was a given. A suggestion from judge and mentor Jonathan Soo was to have us offer hosted server space for the teams and to require everyone to push an initial commit to Github within the first hour of hacking.</li>
	<li>The teams with strong projects at the end either came with an idea or settled on one very quickly. We need a mechanism for teams to find members and for people to think about data and project ideas ahead of time. Some teams spent far too much time arguing over ideas or failed to really evaluate the data they were hoping to use. Suggestions were made for a pre-networking event a week before or a forum or email list for people to talk ahead of time.</li>
	<li>I realized far too late that <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/" target="_blank">our website</a> was good for displaying details on the event planning, but <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/blog-2/" target="_blank">the blog</a> was completely unusable. The commenting system didn't work at all. Next time, we need to test that earlier or set up a functional blog at blog.hackjersey.com.</li>
	<li>Of <a href="https://github.com/hackjersey" target="_blank">our 11 projects</a>, three teams didn't finish enough to present anything beyond what they learned from not finishing. Another four teams had very rough demos, but had proofs of concept to show. So <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/01/28/and-the-winners-are/" target="_blank">four teams finished</a> pretty much functional projects.</li>
	<li>If you want to build a strong community, the best way to start is by recruiting a broad coalition of journalists, developers, designers, hackers, educators, nonprofits and bureaucrats to help plan the event. Thanks in large part to Debbie Galant, we had more than 20 people on our organizing committee, and their ideas and dedication made this hackathon work.</li>
</ul>
All in all, I considered our first Hack Jersey event a success. And that leads us to think about what's next. We have a few ideas:
<ul>
	<li>An ongoing sponsorship from the New Jersey News Commons and the School of Communication and Media at Montclair State University.</li>
	<li>A hack day aimed at scraping a poorly structured public dataset that could be hosted for all to use freely.</li>
	<li>Programming training, perhaps through a partnership with other groups who have already invented that wheel.</li>
	<li>Basic data reporting training, which many working journalists say they are hungry for.</li>
	<li>Solicit ideas for newsroom tools from news organizations large and small. Take that list of use cases and host a hack day or series of hack days to build open source tools.</li>
</ul>
What do you think <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/" target="_blank">Hack Jersey</a> should work on next? What would be most useful to you as a journalist? If you're a developer, what kind of projects would you be interested in working on with us? I'd love to hear your ideas. Please share them in the comments, or email us at hackinfo(at)hackjersey(dot)com.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Webmaster! This is Rubi Nishioka and I just discovered your blog with all these useful posts. It seems that you are really dedicated. However I noticed that your posts are not optimized for full search engine exposure and you are losing out on a lot of visitors and therefor potential revenue and customers. From a quick glance it seems to me that you are running WordPress on your website. This is good News, because there already exist plugins that take care of these optimizations automatically. If you are interested in trying one these plugins check this website --&gt; <a href="http://bit.ly/15gaGx8" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/15gaGx8</a>  If you have any questions send me an email, have a nice day!]]></wp:comment_content>

Thanks for sharing what you learned from your hackathon. It seems to me that many of the things you experienced are common for a lot of hackathons.  In a broad sense I've always thought the main value of these events is gaining a better understanding of the problems - rather than getting solutions. 

In terms of your technology platform to the event, we at ChallengePost at a free platform that supports anyone hosting an in-person hackathon. 

The platform lets hackathon organizers and sponsors show details about their hackathon, accept and display submissions during and after the competition, do judging and voting (both optional), form teams, and allow organizers to encourage participants to keep working on their stuff after it ends.

You can see our platform in action at http://challengepost.com/discover. Please let me know if youâd like to use it and Iâll send you the tools.

Keep hacking!
Richard]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I had a chance to speak at the Society of Professional Journalists' <a href="http://www.spjr1c.org/" target="_blank">Region 1 Spring conference</a>, held at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. <a title="@debgalant on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/debgalant" target="_blank">Debbie Galant</a> of the <a title="NJ News Commons" href="http://njnewscommons.org/" target="_blank">NJ News Commons</a> and I talked about <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/03/11/rounding-up-our-hack-weekend/" target="_blank">the projects that came out of</a> our <a title="Hack Jersey" href="http://www.hackjersey.com/" target="_blank">Hack Jersey</a> hackathon. Then I laid out a map for building data skills in the newsroom.

For those who attended (and those who didn't), here are links to some of the tools we discussed and tutorials to start to learn them.

The slides: <a title="Dive into Data slides" href="http://bit.ly/R1C13DATA" target="_blank">bit.ly/R1C13DATA</a>

We started by sharing examples of data-driven news applications on the web:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Crash Data NJ" href="http://www.crashdatanj.com" target="_blank">CrashDataNJ</a></li>
	<li><a title="Because of Us" href="http://www.becauseofus.net" target="_blank">BecauseofUs.net</a></li>
	<li><a title="Cost of Radiology in NJ" href="http://pancaketheorem.com/stuff/hackjersey/" target="_blank">Cost of Radiology in New Jersey</a></li>
	<li><a title="Ghost Factories" href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/smelting-lead-contamination#explore/" target="_blank">USA Today's "Ghost Factories" project</a></li>
	<li><a title="WNYC's schools waitlist map" href="http://project.wnyc.org/news-maps/schools-waitlists/" target="_blank">WNYC schools waitlist map</a></li>
	<li>ProPublica's <a title="Dollars for Docs" href="http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/" target="_blank">Dollars for Docs</a></li>
</ul>
So how do you do this kind of work (or get to Carnegie Hall)? Practice. Practice. Practice.

A brief detour on the history of data journalism included a data piece in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/video/2013/apr/04/history-of-data-journalism-video" target="_blank">first issue of the Manchester Guardian in 1821</a> and the cover of the program for IRE's <a href="https://twitter.com/mtdukes/status/321331954937122816/photo/1" target="_blank">first computer-assisted reporting conference in 1993</a>. And now, to today...
<h2>The disciplines of data reporting</h2>
<h3>1. Collection</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;" title="PANDA Project" href="http://pandaproject.net/" target="_blank">PANDA Project </a><span style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;">- a newsroom warehouse for data, with </span><a style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;" href="http://pandaproject.net/docs/search-subscriptions.html" target="_blank">search alerts</a><span style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;"> when new data arrives</span></li>
	<li><a style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;" title="FOIA Machine" href="http://www.foiamachine.org/" target="_blank">FOIA Machine</a><span style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;"> - a new site to help track FOIA requests</span></li>
	<li><a style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;" title="DocumentCloud" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/home" target="_blank">DocumentCloud</a><span style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;"> - a free tool for journalists to store, annotate, publish and embed PDF documents</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;">For scraping web pages - </span><a style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;" href="http://www.reporterslab.org/scraping-roundup/" target="_blank">http://www.reporterslab.org/scraping-roundup/</a></li>
	<li><a style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;" title="Comet Docs" href="http://www.cometdocs.com/" target="_blank">Comet Docs</a><span style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;"> - a free service to scrape PDFs</span></li>
	<li><a style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;" title="Tabula" href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-tabula/" target="_blank">Tabula</a><span style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal;"> - a new project to help make PDF scraping easier</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Cleaning</h3>
<ul>
	<li>My go-to cleaning tool for relatively small data sets (less than, say, 10,000 records) is <a title="Open Refine tips" href="http://www.openrefine.org/" target="_blank">Open Refine</a>. Can't say enough good things about it. In this blog post are <a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/2013/02/more-tips-for-using-openrefine/" target="_blank">links to my Open Refine class</a> and several others to get you started.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.twincities.com/thedatamine" target="_blank">MaryJo Webster</a>'s <a title="Excel Magic" href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26567839/My%20Favorite%20%28Excel%29%20Things.pdf" target="_blank">"Excel Magic" class</a> for cleaning data in Excel.</li>
	<li>For the truly adventurous, check out Dan Nguyen's great new ebook <a title="Bastards Book of RegEx" href="http://regex.bastardsbook.com/" target="_self">introducing regular expressions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Analysis</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Excel is going to be your favorite tool ever. There are a number of good tutorials on basic Excel and more advanced Pivot Tables <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/2013/01/17/roadmap-to-data-skills/" target="_blank">listed here</a>,Â as well as a link to a great, free online course introducing databases.</li>
	<li>And don't forget the formula for percent change = (new-old)/old</li>
	<li>Only for a few more days, you can get 50-percent off of all Excel e-books from O'Reilly here: <a title="50 percent off Excel ebooks at O'Reilly" href="http://bit.ly/R1C13EXCEL" target="_blank">bit.ly/R1C13EXCEL</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1.17em;">4. Visualization</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Sharon Machlis of ComputerWorld's great list of <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9214755/Chart_and_image_gallery_30_free_tools_for_data_visualization_and_analysis" target="_blank">30 free dataviz tools</a>.</li>
	<li>A favorite for making embeddable maps and charts, Google's experimental <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/" target="_blank">Fusion Tables</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.tommeagher.com/2012/12/talking-data-in-the-nutmeg-state/" target="_blank">Fusion Tables tutorial</a> (on the second half of the post).</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/184641/?hl=en&amp;" target="_blank">More Fusion Tables tutorials</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9215504/22_free_tools_for_data_visualization_and_analysis?pageNumber=4#tableau" target="_blank">Tableau Public</a>, another free data viz program.</li>
	<li><a title="DataWrapper" href="http://datawrapper.de/" target="_blank">DataWrapper</a>, more free charts, powered by your Google Spreadsheet</li>
	<li>Google's new, free <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/03/create-collaborate-and-share-advanced.html" target="_blank">Map Engine Lite</a></li>
	<li>Make searchable, sortable tables and embed them with <a title="FreeDive" href="http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tools/freedive/" target="_blank">FreeDive</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Interaction</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="https://github.com/hackjersey" target="_blank">open source code from Hack Jersey</a> on Github. (Remember the caveat that this is hackathon code and in most cases probably not ready for prime time)</li>
	<li>The wonderful <a title="Source" href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Source blog</a> from Knight-Mozilla <a title="OpenNews" href="http://www.mozillaopennews.org/" target="_blank">Open News</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Support groups</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a title="IRE" href="http://ire.org/" target="_blank">Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors</a></li>
	<li><a title="NICAR-L" href="http://www.ire.org/resource-center/listservs/subscribe-nicar-l/" target="_self">IRE's NICAR-L email list </a>for computer-assisted reporting and data journalism discussion</li>
