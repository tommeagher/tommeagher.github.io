We wanted to examine data from several sources to piece together what’s really happening. But what we discovered is that it’s very difficult to fight a public health crisis that can’t be measured. The CDC and the federal government can’t really measure the scope of the heroin problem across the nation right now. While many outlets report anecdotes of heroin’s growth, we ended up writing a smart data story that we haven’t seen elsewhere. The data on drug abuse deaths across the country is critically flawed, and until it’s fixed, the public health policy will be too. <a href="http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140512/scope-of-nationwide-heroin-epidemic-unknown-drug-related-death-overdose-data-lacking" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>

We worked closely with colleagues at the York Daily Record to make it into more than just a proof of concept. We redesigned the app to include reporting on the crowded 2014 Pennsylvania gubernatorial primary race, so users could compare their views on hot-button political issues in the Keystone State to the positions of the candidates. This made for an informative and engaging app that was also a lot of fun to play. <a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/waffler-pa/" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>

        <figcaption><a style="text-decoration: underline" href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/newtown911/" target="_blank">Published on 12/6/13</a> <p> We knew the police in Connecticut planned to release the audio from the 911 calls during the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary, but we weren't sure when. The AP reported early that morning that the town had posted the calls on its website, but at first glance, they didn't appear to be there. With a little know-how (and a bit of luck that the site seemingly hadn't been redesigned since the 1990s), I found the files hidden in an unlisted, public section of the site that was difficult to navigate to. Shortly after we found the files, the town removed them from the web, but we had them for four-plus hours before they were officiailly "released" near the end of the day. That head start allowed us to build this engaging presentation to accompany the story. <a href="http://data.digitalfirstmedia.com/newtown911/" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>

Kennedy. Our goal was to find an engaging and unique way to commemorate this historic event. We decided to focus on the mythology around Kennedy's death that in some ways marked the beginning of the conspiracy theory in modern pop culture.

We wanted to know how long veterans home from Iraq and Afghanistan had to wait to receive disability benefits. We also wanted to see how the VA was dealing with what some in Congress were complaining was an excessive backlog of disability cases. We tapped into data collected by the Center for Investigative Reporting through their API and worked with the Tribune on analyzing nearly four years of VA disability cases. To accompany the resulting story, my team also built the interactive chart to show how every regional VA office in the country was faring against the national average. To its credit, after the reporting by us, CIR and many others, the VA worked to improve its systems and start to whittle down the massive backlog that kept injured veterans waiting for care. <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56473395-78/claims-veterans-lake-salt.html.csp?page=1" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>

But my reporter found this simple, but effective story hiding in plain view. When we looked at the state's accident data, it showed that the number of crashes involving cell phones were unchanged in the years since stricter laws had gone into effect. <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/distracted_driving_still_a_pro.html" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>

We were able to quickly scrape the club's site and begin analyzing the thousands of photos we found there before it went offline. And that analysis enabled us to write this gem of a story on excess and bad behavior in a case that ultimately led to several state troopers losing their jobs and pensions in the fallout. <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/driving_club_linked_to_death_r.html" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>

The rates kept going up each year, and some town officials complained that a promised new power plant was way behind schedule. With the help of background sources, the reporter dug deep into internal audits and memos. It took weeks for us to bulletproof the story, but we were able to show that the professional staff believed that $30 million had been wasted on the power plant, and it would never operate. <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/06/rahway_valley_sewerage_authori.html" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>

I built a database of Paterson’s Section 8 payment records and the properties offered to needy renters in the program. By mapping the properties against Census data, we were able to demonstrate that Paterson officials steered voucher recipients into the poorest neighborhoods in the city, in opposition to the intent and regulations of the federal program. <a href="/files/clips/sec8map.pdf" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>

By digging through hundreds of documents and county land records, I built a database that tracked thousands of land transactions and analyzed how the city lost $13 million in potential revenue in the deal. Much to my dismay, due to the sands of time, the Google Map I built that showed data on each property in the scheme is no longer available on the internet. <a href="/files/clips/liens.pdf" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>

For one month, I gave up all my money, moved out of my apartment and got a low-wage job. The resulting story of how I made ends meet resonated with readers across the socioeconomic spectrum, won several state contests and was a finalist in the Deadline Club’s annual awards. <a href="/files/clips/templife.pdf" target="_blank">Read the clip</a></p></figcaption>
