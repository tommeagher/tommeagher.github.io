A tip from a source in Paterson's city government led me to start
looking into a deal in which the mayor sold liens against scores of
abandoned lots to a developer. By digging through hundreds of documents
and county land records, I pulled together data to analyze the \$13
million in potential revenue that the city lost in the deal.

*Two years ago, Paterson faced fiscal ruin.  
Mayor Jose "Joey" Torres needed to find a windfall to make up for a \$9
million deficit in the municipal budget, and he needed it fast.* [The

Many taxpayers complain about conventions and junkets that public
employees go on each year. For this fun story, I pored through piles of
travel expense reports and receipts I received through an open public
records request to show how Paterson officials were spending taxpayer
money at conventions in Atlantic City.

*When Mercer County Assemblyman Bill Baroni needed an example of
wasteful spending and political profligacy, he found exactly what he
needed in Paterson.* [The full story][4]

In the wake of a corruption scandal in Paterson's Section 8 office, we
looked at how the federal rental subsidy program was being administered
locally. I built a database of Paterson's Section 8 payment records and
the properties offered to needy renters in the program. By mapping the
properties against Census data, we were able to demonstrate that
Paterson officials steered voucher recipients into the poorest
neighborhoods in the city, in opposition to the intent and regulations
of the federal program.

*When Michelle Jamison and her family lost their apartment in a fire,
they were given a list of Section 8 properties by the city to find a new
place.  
“The list that they gave us was all horrible areas — all in the 4th
Ward,” Jamison said. Jamison said she questioned why the city agency,
seeing that she had a teenage daughter, would only recommend what she
considered high-crime areas... “They said that’s what they had
available, and this was their list, and pretty much take it or leave
it."*[The full story][5]

I wanted to find a compelling way to illustrate the challenges that
face the working poor and immigrants in North Jersey. For one month, I
gave up all my money, moved out of my apartment and got a low-wage job.
The resulting story of how I made ends meet resonated with readers
across the socioeconomic spectrum, won several state contests and was a
finalist in the Deadline Club's annual awards.

*In just two days, my \$424 dwindled to \$110. It all adds up: jitney
rides to look for apartments, phone cards to answer job ads. I eat a
dinner of \$2 cheeseburgers...* [The full story][6] & [the layout][]

After covering the city of Paterson for more than 18 months, I had
developed the kind of sources that make a story like this possible.
Several officials and employees tipped me off and then related a
discussion that took place in a confidential, closed-door council
session about a longtime city lawyer fired for harassing a secretary at
a public meeting. The incident ended up costing the cash-strapped city
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

*Alston, who serves as secretary to Council President Kenneth M. Morris,
Jr., alleged that Gordon removed his shoes during a meeting to run his
feet up and down her leg under the council table.* [The full story][7]

One morning, while covering a court case, a lawyer whispered to me,
"Did you hear what they found at the Meadowlands?" (Not Jimmy Hoffa's
body) I raced back to the newsroom and broke this story, beating the
state's two major dailies. This case of unsecured, hazardous chemicals
sitting along the rail lines was a timely warning from a neighboring
town that came just as similar rail transfer stations were popping up in
our area.

*He later said he found that federal standards label the powder as 10
times as poisonous as hydrogen cyanide.  
"This is nasty stuff," Oelrich said.* [The full story][8]

Paterson is the kind of failed industrial town that has bred
generations of poverty and violence, gangs and drugs. I found a young
filmmaker whose work both chronicled and helped to define the city's
street life. The irony was that Rob Jackson hoped that the success of
his homemade DVDs would allow him to escape the crime and violence his
films banked on.  

*His camera bounced erratically and leapt out of focus. Lit only by
street lamps, he stopped in the middle of an intersection to capture a
shot of the loser curled up on the ground as three acquaintances punched
and kicked him.  
When another man tried to intervene, he, too, was knocked to the ground
and pummeled.* [The full story][9]

Assigned to cover an event commemorating Black History Month, I heard a
retired police officer make an off-hand remark about playing on a
segregated basketball team nearly 50 years before. His comment led me to
this story of Lawrence, Kansas' forgotten history of inequality.  

*"I didn't have a chance to buy a yearbook in 1933," Newman said. "I
didn't have the money to have my picture put in it. My name is in there,
but my picture's not in there."* [The full story][10]

[One of my reporters][]had begun looking at a local sewer authority that
serves a number of the towns in his municipal beat. The sewer rates kept
going up each year, and some town officials complained that a promised
new power plant was way behind schedule. With the help of background
sources, the writer dug deep into internal audits and memos that showed
the body's professional staff believed that \$30 million had been wasted
on the power plant that would never operate. It took weeks to
bulletproof the story, but it provided a good service for the sewer
ratepayers in 14 towns across two counties.

*Woodbridge Mayor John E. McCormac, a vocal critic of the authority,
said the RVSA's commissioners should be embarrassed. "They've literally
cost their residents millions of dollars unnecessarily," he said.*An

A freelancer pitched a story about a popular new chain of ultracheap
thrift stores popping up in former big box locations around New Jersey.
As she dug into the story and got deeper, she realized there was more to
it. The thrift chain was using charities to solicit donations. In turn,
it paid the charities pennies on the dollar for goods that it resold to
bargain-hunters, without disclosing to donors or shoppers the
relationship. The reporter dug through federal tax and corporate filings
and state charity records to piece together the complex business
dealings of the company and its non-profit partners.

*"I would hope people who have something valuable to donate wouldn't
donate this way."* A [very early draft][] and the [final story][]

———————————

Looking for stories about people who live in her beat, [my reporter][]
found a Google News item that mentioned in passing the arrest of a
teenager accused of attacking the Church of Scientology's website. No
one had covered his trial in federal court, where he was the only person
who pleaded guilty to participating in an online war between a group of
hackers and Scientology. She dug into the young man's voluminous online
activities, sifted through court documents and interviewed experts in
the case to piece together how a childish prank landed the college
student in prison for a year.

*The cyber vigilantes kept up the attack for at least 12 days.... Others
made prank calls to the "mother church" in Los Angeles and sent faxes of
black paper to use up the toner in the fax machines.* A [rough draft][],
a [later draft][] and the [full story][11]

When Hurricane Noel hit in the fall of 2007, it ravaged the Dominican
Republic. Paterson, N.J. has one of the largest Dominican expatriate
communities in the U.S., and its residents jumped to collect donations
and supplies for relief. [One of my reporters][12] tapped into a group
of local Dominicans headed to the island to help, and she tagged along.
On her first overseas reporting experience, she lost her suitcase en
route. When she arrived, she reported and wrote this story in a day and
a half, transmitting it via email over a dial-up internet connection
threatened by sporadic power outages. The edited story turned out to be
a great tale.

*The 31-year-old scrambled to his roof. As the water rose, he clung to
the branches of a nearby avocado tree to keep from being swept away.  
For four hours, 15 others clung there with him.*The [rough draft][13]
and the [full story][14]

Before going to the Dominican Republic, my reporter had heard concerns
about a town with a baseball stadium that regularly hosted barnstorming
Paterson teams. She traveled to the town to survey the damage even as
Dominicans in New Jersey were raising money to rebuild. She found it was
hit far worse than expected and turned this story around in one day.

*The stadium here, with its manicured outfield and roofed bleachers, was
the pride of this rural province.... But overnight, the stadium
vanished, swept away by Hurricane Noel.* The [rough draft][15] and the
[full story][16]

———————————

A Google alert from a Wisconsin newspaper tipped us to this story of a
family that had its bags stolen on vacation and caught the thief while
posting for a snapshot. My reporter tracked down the vacationing
family's grandfather who put her in touch with them, and she turned it
around in an afternoon.

*Sure enough, there he was behind them: A man in a baseball cap, black
shirt and brown dress shoes, in the process of picking up their bag.*

A councilwoman in one of my reporters' beats came up with a novel way
to squash criticism from borough residents. She floated a proposal to
stop airing the public's comments during the council's televised
meetings. Without this story, the public could have been blindsided by
the unusual political maneuver.

*"Frankly, the message that it sends is that the council doesn't value
the public's comments as much as their own."*The [first draft][] and the
[full story][18]

<a name="read2"></a>**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Readers</span>**  
My reporter received a press release for a photo op at a local business
that had gotten a contract to work on the rebuilding of the former World
Trade Center site. I coached her to dig into the story and talk about
the unique experiences this company had working on one of the most
high-profile projects in the world.

*When Jim Murray got the contract to provide steel for the base of one
of the buildings planned for Ground Zero, his Orange-based company faced
a series of challenging requirements.  
The structure must be constructed of steel, but be open and airy.  
It must be assembled without a modern crane, using a block and tackle
system.  
It must pass bomb-blasting tests.*An [early draft][19] and the [full
story][20]

One great place to mine for stories: the death notices. We spotted this
run-of-the-mill obituary that mentioned a dying woman's love of travel
and her hope to see the world. I worked with the reporter to go to her
grieving family and ask the right questions to get the telling details
to tell this woman's touching story.

*Three years ago, facing a terminal illness, Teresita Canete quit her
job, and she and her husband embarked on a quest to visit as many of the
world's great landmarks as they could. Before she died last month, she
managed to see more than a dozen on four continents.*An [early
draft][21] and the [full story][22]
