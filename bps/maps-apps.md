### [Median incomes dropping][]

I conducted the analysis of Census data for this story on median
incomes, and I used the [Fusion Tables Layer builder][] to create the
map. On this project, I was excited to figure out how to position the
key inside the map frame.

### [NJ Rock & Pop Hall of Fame timeline][]

At the Star-Ledger, I used ProPublica's [TimelineSetter][] tool to pull
together photos, video and documents to create this interactive element
for our New Jersey Rock & Pop Hall of Fame special section. More
recently, I've used [Timeline.js][] to create timelines of video clips
during the presidential debates and [MinnPost's fork][] of WNYC's
[vertical timeline][] for a story ahead of [Supreme Court arguments][]
on gay marriage cases.

### [Census demographics tables][]

Using the LA Times' [Table Stacker][], I took Census data that I had
analyzed for New Jersey towns and created the searchable table. I built
the map using Google Fusion Tables and embedded it in the html that
Table Stacker baked out.

-------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to producing interactives for news events, I have also built
a number of applications in Python for personal projects. Using the
[Flask microframework][], I [made a tumbleblog][] called [Carboy][] to
chronicle the beer I brew at home. I also made a Flask [app to log
ideas][] [called Alva][].

And in the days leading up to this year's Computer-Assisted Reporting
conference, I made a Python program to collect and aggregate tweets
around an event. The [hashevents scripts][] powered a simple leaderboard
of the [most popular URLs shared and the most active Twitter users][] at
\#NICAR13.
