I'm an investigative journalist and editor, and I enjoy leading ambitious, highly collaborative reporting projects that expose how our governments and the powerful fail us. I love working on accountability stories with other journalists and have edited pieces that have been co-published with dozens of news outlets. 
&nbsp;<br /><br />
For more than a decade, I've been lucky enough to work at a top-notch investigative newsroom as an editor at [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/) — the nonpartisan, nonprofit covering crime and justice in the U.S. I oversee The Marshall Project's coverage of prisons, jails and the death penalty. I've helped it to grow from a scrappy band of about 20 people to now more than 80 employees across the country.
&nbsp;<br /><br />
I spearheaded "[The Next To Die](https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die)," a data-rich project that tracked every person scheduled to be executed in the U.S. This complex effort relied on a network that I built of journalists across 10 newsrooms who followed each capital case. I edited the project over its run of more than five years. When we wound down "The Next to Die," I wrote a story analyzing [what it taught us about the practice of capital punishment today](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/02/10/what-120-executions-tell-us-about-criminal-justice-in-america).
&nbsp;<br /><br />
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I oversaw our work [tracking coronavirus cases and deaths in prisons](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons), leading a team of dozens of reporters from The Marshall Project and the Associated Press who tallied outbreaks every week for more than a year.
&nbsp;<br /><br />
I edited “[Detained](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/09/24/detained),” a multimedia examination of the century-long history of immigration detention in the U.S. And I produced “[The Zo](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/02/27/welcome-to-the-zo),” a series of animated short films illustrated by Molly Crabapple and narrated by Michael K. Williams that explored the surreal nature of life in prison. 
&nbsp;<br /><br />
As a reporter and data journalist, I worked with two Marshall Project colleagues to report a series of stories co-published with The New York Times on how New York [prison officials fail to fire correctional officers](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/05/19/new-york-prison-corrections-officer-abuse-prisoners) after they are credibly accused of [serious abuse of incarcerated people and cover-ups](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/05/22/new-york-prison-corrections-officer-abuse-cover-up). 
&nbsp;<br /><br />
[Projects that I edited](clips.html) have won National Magazine Awards, national Edward R. Murrow awards, Online Journalism Awards, a Society for News Design gold medal, a National Headliner Award, and more. [My reporting](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/tom-meagher)  has been honored with a Robert F. Kennedy Award for criminal justice reporting, a Nonprofit News Award for investigative journalism, a “Human Rights” award from Malofiej, and a Data Journalism Award, among others.

&nbsp;<br /><br />
A news leader, I helped to build and launch three newsrooms from the ground up, and I have managed interdisciplinary teams of visual journalists, designers, developers and data journalists. I regularly teach investigative and data reporting skills, passing along my own hard-earned knowledge and practices to early-career journalists and students at [conferences and universities around the world](classes.html).
&nbsp;<br /><br />
I live in New Jersey with my family, and in my free time, I enjoy music, running and playing and watching soccer.
