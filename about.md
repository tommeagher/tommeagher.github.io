I'm the deputy managing editor at [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/), a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization covering crime and justice in America. At the Marshall Project, I'm part of the team that built [The Next To Die](https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die), a data-rich project tracking executions in 10 states.

I specialize in investigative, data and interactive journalism, including:

* data analysis
* Freedom of Information requests
* [computer-assisted reporting](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/tom-meagher)
* [visualizations](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/tom-meagher)
* [interactive graphics](clips.html)
* and [news applications](https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die)

A [veteran reporter and editor](http://linkedin.com/in/tommeagher), I've taught data and investigative reporting skills to journalists and students at [conferences and universities around the world](classes.html).

I live in New Jersey, where I co-founded [Hack Jersey](http://www.hackjersey.com/), a group of journalists and programmers working together to improve the news.

In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching soccer and [brewing my own beer](http://carboy.tommeagher.com/).
