An investigative journalist and news hacker, I'm the data editor at [The Marshall Project](http://www.themarshallproject.org/), a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization covering crime and justice in America.

I specialize in several aspects of investigative and interactive journalism, including data analysis, Freedom of Information requests, computer-assisted reporting, editing, visualization, interactive graphics and news applications.

I live in New Jersey, where I co-founded [Hack Jersey](http://www.hackjersey.com/), a group of journalists and programmers dedicated to working together to improve the news.
