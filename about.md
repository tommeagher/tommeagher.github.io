An investigative journalist and news hacker, I'm the data editor at [The Marshall Project](http://www.themarshallproject.org/), a nonprofit news organization covering crime and justice in America. I also co-founded [Hack Jersey](http://www.hackjersey.com/).

I like to tell important, deeply reported stories using narrative, numbers, documents, design and code.

My specialties are data analysis, Freedom of Information negotiations, computer-assisted reporting, editing, training, visualization, interactive graphics and news applications.

Not too long ago, this site migrated from a previous version. If you see anything weird, please help me out by filing [a bug report](https://github.com/tommeagher/tommeagher.github.io/issues) on Github.
