In a journalism industry that's been marked by turmoil and erosion, I've been lucky to work at a top-notch news organization for more than a decade now. I'm a senior editor at [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/), the nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom covering crime and justice in America and have been here since its inception in 2014. I've helped to grow it from a scrappy band of about 20 people in New York City to now more than 80 employees spread across the country. 
&nbsp;<br /><br />
As an editor, I oversee our coverage of prisons, jails and the death penalty. Working with colleagues, I undertook the data analysis for and helped report a series of stories on [how New York prisons rarely fire officers](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/tom-meagher) accused of seriously abusing people in their custody. I was part of the team that built [The Next To Die](https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die), a data-rich project that tracked executions in 15 states. When we wound down The Next to Die after more than five years, I wrote this story sharing [what we learned about capital punishment in the U.S.](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/02/10/what-120-executions-tell-us-about-criminal-justice-in-america) I also led our effort with The Associated Press to [document cases of COVID-19 — and deaths — in U.S. prisons](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons), week-in and week-out during the height of the pandemic. 
&nbsp;<br /><br />
[My reporting](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/tom-meagher) has been honored by the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards, the Nonprofit News Awards, the Data Journalism Awards and the international Malofiej's first human rights special award, among others. Projects I edited have received national Edward R. Murrow awards, National Magazine Awards and many more.
&nbsp;<br /><br />
In addition to reporting and editing, I've taught journalists and students at [conferences and universities around the world](classes.html).
&nbsp;<br /><br />
I live in New Jersey with my family, and in my free time, I enjoy music, running and playing and watching soccer.
