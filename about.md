A journalist, nerd and news hacker, I'm the data editor at Digital First Media's [Project Thunderdome](http://www.insidethunderdome.com/) and co-founder of [Hack Jersey](http://www.hackjersey.com/).

I like to tell important, deeply reported stories using narrative, numbers, documents, design and code.

This blog is in transition from an old version. There are likely to be hiccups along the way. If you see anything weird, you can help by filing [a bug report](https://github.com/tommeagher/tommeagher.github.io/issues) on Github.
