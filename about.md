A journalist, nerd and news hacker, I'm the data editor at Digital First Media's [Project Thunderdome](http://www.insidethunderdome.com/) and co-founder of [Hack Jersey](http://www.hackjersey.com/).

I like to tell important, deeply reported stories using narrative, numbers, documents, design and code.
