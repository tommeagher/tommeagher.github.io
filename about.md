A journalist and news hacker, I'm the deputy managing editor at [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/), a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization covering crime and justice in America.

I specialize in investigative and interactive journalism, including:

* data analysis 
* Freedom of Information requests
* [computer-assisted reporting](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/tom-meagher)
* [visualizations](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/tom-meagher)
* [interactive graphics](clips.html)
* and [news applications](clips.html)

A veteran reporter and editor, I've taught these skills to journalists and students at [conferences and universities across the country](classes.html).

I live in New Jersey, where I co-founded [Hack Jersey](http://www.hackjersey.com/), a group of journalists and programmers working together to improve the news.

In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching soccer and [brewing my own beer](http://carboy.tommeagher.com/).
