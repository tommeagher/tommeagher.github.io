I'm a senior editor at [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/), the nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization covering crime and justice in America. I lead collaborative, data-driven reporting projects and oversee our coverage of prisons, jails and the death penalty. While I managed our data and digital teams, our newsroom won the National Magazine Awards for best website twice and another time for digital innovation, as well as the Online Journalism Award for General Excellence. As a reporter, my work has been honored with a Data Journalism Award and the international Malofiej's first human rights special award. 

I've been an editor at The Marshall Project since its launch in 2014, and I was part of the team that built [The Next To Die](https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die), a data-rich project that tracked executions in 15 states. After more than five and a half years, we wound down The Next to Die, and I wrote this story sharing [what we learned about capital punishment in the U.S.](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/02/10/what-120-executions-tell-us-about-criminal-justice-in-america)

I specialize in investigative data journalism, including:

* data analysis
* Freedom of Information requests
* [computer-assisted reporting](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/tom-meagher)
* [visualizations](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/tom-meagher)
* [interactive graphics](clips.html)
* and [news applications](https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die)

A [veteran reporter and editor](http://linkedin.com/in/tommeagher), I've taught journalists and students at [conferences and universities around the world](classes.html).

I live in New Jersey, where I co-founded [Hack Jersey](http://www.hackjersey.com/), a group of journalists and programmers working together to improve the news. In my free time, I enjoy running and playing and watching soccer.
