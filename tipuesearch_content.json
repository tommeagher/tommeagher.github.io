            "text": "\nCross-posted from the Sunlight Foundation\u2019s OpenGov Voices blog.\nA few weeks ago, Hack Jersey brought a group of journalists and developers together to wrestle with campaign finance data. We thought it would be a good opportunity for many to get their hands dirty and to start thinking about new ways of reporting and building with the\u00a0data.\nIn one room of our event at the\u00a0New Jersey Institute of Technology, a group of journalists went on a data expedition, learning how to explore reports from the state\u2019s\u00a0Election Law Enforcement Commission. In another, we gathered developers to try to build a campaign finance app for New Jersey using the\u00a0Sunlight Foundation\u2019s APIs in a single work\u00a0session.\nWe began Hack Jersey about a year ago, starting with some conversations between journalists and developers who wanted to work together to improve news and data in the Garden State. Since then, with the support of the\u00a0NJ News Commons and\u00a0Knight-Mozilla OpenNews, we sponsored the\u00a0first news-themed hackathon in New Jersey and several smaller training\u00a0events.\nWe\u2019ve been eager to take the excitement from the traditional hackathon competition and translate it into projects that news organizations and news consumers can actually use. We wanted our\u00a0\u201cLaw, Money & Politics\u201d hackday to entice developers to work together to solve a news problem instead of competing against one another. We were psyched to be able to use Sunlight\u2019s APIs in that effort and to have the support of the foundation, which helped sponsor our\u00a0event.\nThere was clearly an interest among developers in this approach. About 15 coders\u2014from computer science programs at local universities, the startup community and nearby news organizations\u2014came to work, and another four helped us plan the project in our pre-hack\u00a0meetups.\nAs the group took shape, we needed to figure out what we wanted to build. We spent almost four hours over two weeks talking and thinking about ideas we solicited from local news organizations. What problem did we want our app to\u00a0solve?\nWe all agreed that campaign finance is a murky, labyrinthine realm and that people in New Jersey could use all the help they could get understanding it. We love the Sunlight Foundation\u2019s\u00a0InfluenceExplorer API and the way it makes state data, cleaned and cared for by the\u00a0National Institute for Money in State Politics, accessible. We could spend a whole hack day or two trying to mold our state ELEC data into a more useful format, but InfluenceExplorer and NIMSP has done a lot of that dirty work for\u00a0us.\nAfter what we thought was much discussion and tinkering with the\u00a0API, we zeroed in on the idea of comparing campaign donations coming from industries into state elections. What industries were backing the most winners in New Jersey? How was campaign spending by industry changing from cycle to cycle? What industries were behind some of our more notable\u00a0politicians?\nHackers at Hack Jersey\u2019s Law, Money and Politics Hack day. Photo by Tom\u00a0Meagher.\nWith that much decided, our team members volunteered to take certain development roles, and we got ready for the hack day. We imagined a front page with a 30,000-foot-view that would show charts of how much industries have spent on all New Jersey campaigns available in the data, going back more than 10 years. After that, we thought our user could drill in to look at specific industries and how their spending changed from cycle to cycle. Or you could put candidates in specific races side-by-side to see what industries supported\u00a0them.\nBut we quickly realized that the API, which offers access to individual campaign donations by state, only really returns requests for top industry spending across the whole nation. There was no method (yet) to let us grab the top industries in just a certain state or a specific\u00a0year.\nAs the day went on, we hit a few more snags when we realized there wasn\u2019t an easy way through the API to get all the candidates who lost elections. So we downloaded the\u00a0bulk data from Influence Explorer and pulled those candidates out ourselves. With each unexpected misstep, the minutes and hours flew by. In the hopes of finishing a project, we\u2019d shrink the scope and tighten our\u00a0focus.\nWe finally decided, with a couple of hours left, that we could build a demo app that would let you pick an election cycle in New Jersey, and then browse the available races and see what industries supported each candidate. Two of our developers, who also happen to be the leads for our event sponsor Broadstreet Ads, led the final sprint. They helped pull together a Python web.py framework with Angular.js and Highcharts to power the front end. We could almost see the finish line. And then we ran out of\u00a0time.\nIt\u2019s hard to build anything in 8 hours, much less bring 15 people together to make a single, deep and useful news application. Although we fell short, we had fun and learned a lot in the process for how to do it better next\u00a0time:\n\nWe could have had a better handle on the very wide range of experience and backgrounds our developers brought to the team. By taking a little more time talking about our skills, we could have focused our project more closely on an attainable goal for such a short window of coding. Time is expensive and in short supply. There is no time for\u00a0indecision.\nDouble the time spent planning before the event, and then double it again. Although we did a good job of considering the overall vision and anticipating some of the quirks of the data, we needed to set very specific tasks for everyone on the team and make sure people were clear about their roles and comfortable. A large group doesn\u2019t always lend itself easily to collaborative exploration or problem solving. People need to feel like they\u2019re in the mix, especially if they\u2019re giving up a Saturday for a civic hack\u00a0project.\nDo more pair programming. With so many developers, we should have put everyone in pairs from the outset, so each person would have a buddy to help spot mistakes and typos that can eat up precious time. We also could have designated experienced developers as leaders for each aspect (back end, front end, design, documentation), who could have helped make some of the design and implementation decisions more\u00a0quickly.\nRead the documentation. Test the methods. It seems so simple, but although we spent a few hours with the Influence Explorer documentation, we still kept finding unexpected nuances in the data it returned, very late in the day. If we had spent more time with it, we could have spotted potential detours more\u00a0quickly.\n\nThis was an experiment for us. Some experiments don\u2019t work, but\u00a0you can learn a lot from failure. Nearly everyone who participated said they want to work on more news hacking initiatives in the future. Several have said they plan to dig deeper into campaign finance and Sunlight\u2019s\u00a0APIs.\nAre you interested in our idea? Take a look at the repo,\u00a0fork it and hack away. We\u2019d love to get others involved, whether you\u2019re from New Jersey or\u00a0elsewhere.\nAlthough we didn\u2019t get as far as we would have liked, it was a good experience for us at Hack Jersey. We got 15 developers thinking about campaign finance and starting to learn the ins, the outs and the\u00a0possibilities.\nWe couldn\u2019t grow an orchard in a day, but we planted a lot of good seeds. And that\u2019s a pretty good place to\u00a0start.",

            "text": "It all started in September, at the Online News Association\u2018s\nconference in San Francisco. I crashed the [#wjchat][] party and ended\nup meeting the infamous Debbie Galant, the force of nature behind\nBaristanet who was just starting the NJ News Commons. We talked\nabout journalism in Jersey. I floated the idea of a news hackathon, and\nshe was\u00a0intrigued.\nFast forward through a hurricane, an election, months of planning and\npromotion, and 24 hours of hacking. I sat in a lecture hall at\nMontclair State University listening in awe to 11 teams of journalists\nand programmers pitch their projects to change news in New\u00a0Jersey.\n[Of course, I\u2019m glossing over many logistical details here. I\u2019ll just\nsay that we could not have pulled it off without the generosity and\nadvice of our sponsors and partners, especially the News Commons and\nthe university, Knight-Mozilla OpenNews, CartoDB,\nO\u2019Reilly, The Star-Ledger, The Record, Patch, Echo\nand many\u00a0others.]\nI couldn\u2019t believe we pulled it off. There\u2019s no way I could have\nimagined in September how much I\u2019d learn about building community,\nblending cultures and sowing the seeds for us to think about news and\ndata in new ways. Among those\u00a0lessons:\n\nIt was a serious miscalculation on my part to try to start at 9 a.m.\n    on a Saturday. Neither journalists nor developers are early risers.\n    As we waited for folks to drift in, we had to start late and rush\n    some of the presentations.\nOne of the biggest challenges was trying to manage people\u2019s\n    expectations of what they\u2019d get out of giving up a weekend to stare\n    at a computer screen on a college campus. Some people wanted to\n    learn to code. Others wanted nerds to help them with their next big\n    project. A few, I imagine, wanted to network for a job. We wanted\n    everyone to feel like she or he could be a part of this experience\n    and could offer something, no matter previous experience or skill\n    level. For some newsroom denizens whose only exposure to developers\n    was their much maligned IT staff, this was a revolutionary idea.\n    They have been trained to treat technologists like a deli counter:\n    Order up whatever newfangled internet thing you need and wait for it\n    to show up. My hope was at the end of the hackathon, our reporters\n    and developers could start to imagine how they can work together. I\n    think on that front we\u00a0succeeded.\nWe may have overloaded the schedule with speakers, and our talks\n    were geared too heavily toward journalists. Some of the participants\n    would have liked more discussion of the process of creating news\n    apps rather than the concepts of data journalism and news app\n    thinking. Others wanted less yakking and more\u00a0hacking.\nIt\u2019s just as important for us to bring programmers to the news world\n    as it is to introduce journalists to the development process. We\n    succeeded on the latter, but we need to do more for the former. We\n    could have used speakers from the tech world who would have lured\n    more\u00a0programmers.\nI wish we had more diversity in our roster of speakers. I was\n    thrilled to have Emily Bell as one of our judges.\u00a0A majority of\n    the folks on our planning committee were women, as were many of our\n    participants. But I think we erred in not having more women\n    presenters, giving a false impression of the state of news\n    development and the programming world as a\u00a0whole.\nWe just didn\u2019t have enough developers. We needed to have more than\n    one on each team, preferably someone with backend skills and someone\n    else with frontend skills. Some of the teams had one developer and\n    four journalists. That just didn\u2019t\u00a0work.\nWe found some teams didn\u2019t need more than one or two journalists,\n    even those with significant computer-assisted reporting skills. Some\n    of the CAR veterans had a hard time translating their expertise in\n    analyzing data to the idea of developing a reusable\u00a0application.\nTo my surprise, many of the programmers were not really familiar\n    with version control or git. Only Sunday morning, as the\n    deadline loomed, did some teams ask about how to use Github, leaving\n    me to run around and teach people. Some teams also didn\u2019t have\n    server space to host a demo site, something I assumed was a given. A\n    suggestion from judge and mentor Jonathan Soo was to have us offer\n    hosted server space for the teams and to require everyone to push an\n    initial commit to Github within the first hour of\u00a0hacking.\nThe teams with strong projects at the end either came with an idea\n    or settled on one very quickly. We need a mechanism for teams to\n    find members and for people to think about data and project ideas\n    ahead of time. Some teams spent far too much time arguing over ideas\n    or failed to really evaluate the data they were hoping to use.\n    Suggestions were made for a pre-networking event a week before or a\n    forum or email list for people to talk ahead of\u00a0time.\nI realized far too late that our website was good for displaying\n    details on the event planning, but the blog was completely\n    unusable. The commenting system didn\u2019t work at all. Next time, we\n    need to test that earlier or set up a functional blog at\u00a0blog.hackjersey.com.\nOf our 11 projects, three teams didn\u2019t finish enough to present\n    anything beyond what they learned from not finishing. Another four\n    teams had very rough demos, but had proofs of concept to show. So\n    four teams finished pretty much functional\u00a0projects.\nIf you want to build a strong community, the best way to start is by\n    recruiting a broad coalition of journalists, developers, designers,\n    hackers, educators, nonprofits and bureaucrats to help plan the\n    event. Thanks in large part to Debbie Galant, we had more than 20\n    people on our organizing committee, and their ideas and dedication\n    made this hackathon\u00a0work.\n\nAll in all, I considered our first Hack Jersey event a success. And that\nleads us to think about what\u2019s next. We have a few\u00a0ideas:\n\nAn ongoing sponsorship from the New Jersey News Commons and the\n    School of Communication and Media at Montclair State\u00a0University.\nA hack day aimed at scraping a poorly structured public dataset that\n    could be hosted for all to use\u00a0freely.\nProgramming training, perhaps through a partnership with other\n    groups who have already invented that\u00a0wheel.\nBasic data reporting training, which many working journalists say\n    they are hungry\u00a0for.\nSolicit ideas for newsroom tools from news organizations large and\n    small. Take that list of use cases and host a hack day or series of\n    hack days to build open source\u00a0tools.\n\nWhat do you think Hack Jersey should work on next? What\nwould be most useful to you as a journalist? If you\u2019re a developer, what\nkind of projects would you be interested in working on with us? I\u2019d love\nto hear your ideas. Please share them in the comments, or email us at\u00a0hackinfo(at)hackjersey(dot)com.",

            "text": "At this week\u2019s computer-assisted reporting conference in Louisville,\nIRE has me doing double-duty. In addition to my class on OpenRefine,\nI\u2019m also teaching a hands-on session on git and Github.\nThis assumes you\u2019ve already downloaded git and created an account on\nGithub. I use the command line, although if you master that, the GUI\nclients will be a piece of\u00a0cake.\nI\u2019ve somehow,\u00a0inadvertently\u00a0become a bit of a Git evangelist, not out of\nany mastery, but mostly because of my convert\u2019s zeal for version\ncontrol. \u00a0And the one-two punch of git and Github have changed the way I\nthink about my job, web development and sharing knowledge. Here\u2019s a\nquick run-through of the class. If you\u2019re a visual learner, the slides\nare here:\u00a0http://bit.ly/car13gitslides\nWhat is\u00a0git?\n\na distributed version control system (If this doesn\u2019t mean\n    anything to you, don\u2019t sweat it. It\u2019s mostly for the\u00a0nerds)\na command line utility to track changes to a file and to share those\n    changes with\u00a0others.\ngood for any kind of text - stories, csv, html, .js, .py,\u00a0.rb.\nnot so great with images, audio,\u00a0video\n\nWhat does git\u00a0do?\nIn a broad\noversimplification, it uses diff to compare every addition and\nsubtraction in your code and shows you how your files\u00a0evolve.\nIt lets you take snapshots of your code and roll through them over time\n(or back in time) as needed to follow how a file changes from save to\nsave to save. And you can have several authors of a file branch off\ntheir own versions to edit and then later merge them all back together\ninto one master\u00a0file.\n\nHow does it\u00a0work?\nThere\u2019s a lot of things going on behind the curtain in git, that you can\nfigure out eventually, but don\u2019t worry about it here. For right now,\nbasically you only need to really know six\u00a0commands.\nThe first thing you want to know\u00a0is\ngit status\n\nThis will orient you to where you are, what files have changed and\nwhether you\u2019ve saved your snapshot of your project (which we\u2019ll soon\nstart calling a \u201ccommit\u201d). This is your\u00a0friend.\nWhere you work and where you edit your code is the working directory.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to take a snapshot of your code, you \u201cadd\u201d your file\nto the staging\u00a0area.\ngit add foo.py\n\n\nAfter you\u2019ve made all the changes you want, and you\u2019ve \u201cadded\u201d all of\nyour updated files to the staging area, it\u2019s time to make a commit. And\nwith each commit, you want to add a short message describing what the\nchanges\u00a0are.\ngit commit -m \"finally debugged my own idiocy. maybe...\"\n\nNow all of your updates are saved in your file respository, and if you\nwant to, you can your snapshot is made. You could very easily stop here\nand just keep the audit trail on your machine. But the other half of\nthis happy marriage is Github.\n\nWhat is\u00a0Github?\n\nGithub\nis a social coding site, and it\u2019s a hosted remote repository.\n\nIt\nlets you back up all of your code online (for free if it\u2019s open source),\nand it lets you see how other developers do it and learn from their\u00a0work. \nHere\u2019s\nhow you do\u00a0it: \ngit push -u origin master\n\nYou\n\u201cpush\u201d your code from the \u201cmaster\u201d branch that\u2019s on your machine to your\nremote repository on Github, which we call \u201corigin.\u201d (This may have\nalready been configured for you if you cloned your repo from github.\nOtherwise, you would have\u00a0to \ngit remote add origin git@github.com:tommeagher/myrepo.git\n\n)\nOne of the many great things about Github is that you can see the diff\nin your files without the Matrix hypnosis of command\u00a0line.\nThe last couple commands I\u2019ll tell you are how you get your commits from\nthe remote repository on Github back on your\u00a0machine.\nYou can\u00a0use\n git fetch origin\n\nto gather the updated files from your remote \u201corigin\u201d repository. Now\nyou want to \u201cmerge\u201d the changes from the master branch on your remote\n\u201corigin\u201d repository into your master branch on your\u00a0machine.\ngit merge origin/master\n\nNow your files are updated from the remote repository. Now keep\u00a0coding.\nIf you want more, you can visit the repo for this class, where I\nhave a cheat sheet for the most common basic uses and commands and more\nin-depth\u00a0tutorials.\nThis really just deals with the basics. We haven\u2019t even had a chance to\ntalk about merge problems, branching, forkingor cloning,\nbut you know how to Google, so you can figure it out. Fork my repo,\nimprove the cheat sheet and send me a pull\u00a0request.\nWhat\u2019s your favorite tip or cheat in git? Leave me a comment. I\u2019d love\nto read\u00a0it.",

On a Thursday\nevening, I took the Amtrak train home to New Jersey, feeling good about\nturning a group of journalists on to the power and fun of incorporating\ndata into their\u00a0reporting.\nThe next morning, the horrible shooting at Newtown Elementary School\nthrew our world upside-down. Only now, more than two months later, have\nI been able to take a moment to revisit the rough notes and links I\ndumped here in December to try to make them a little more\u00a0useful.\nThe first class was an overview discussion of \u201cdata journalism\u201d and the\nmany and sundry techniques that encompasses. The second class was a\nhands-on walk-through of Excel and Google Fusion Tables. The handouts\nand cheatsheets cover nearly all of the tips we discussed. If you have\nquestions, or would like to know more, please leave a comment or send me\nan\u00a0email.\nIntro to data -slide\u00a0deck\nHandouts:\n\nNewsroom math\u00a0overview\nNumbers in the Newsroom by Sarah\u00a0Cohen\nNewsroom math crib sheet by Steve\u00a0Doig\n\nExtra\u00a0reading\n\nThe roots of \u201cprecision\u00a0journalism\u201d\nHow Jason Hoppin predicted a close local\u00a0election\nA video of Ben Welsh\u2018s talk on data journalism. He explains\n    it very well,\u00a0\u201dIt\u2019s only in journalism that we continue to\n    distinguish ourselves with the use of Microsoft\u00a0Excel.\u201d\n\n\nHands-on Excel & Fusion Tables\u00a0class\n\nData for Excel\u00a0exercises\n\nSchoolsdatav1.xlsx\n2010-2011hs-prresults.xlsx\nDemographicSnapshotEdited.xlsx\nAppointments.xls\nCrony.xls\ncitybud.xls\n\nLet\u2019s do something fun and map the data for a story, using Google\u2019s\nexperimental (and free) Fusion Tables program. We\u2019re going to\ndownload a spreadsheet in the CSV format of the violent crime rates for\nevery town in\u00a0Connecticut.\nGo to DataHaven.org Go to indicators>Public safety>Community\nsafety>Violent crimes> total violent crime rate\nSelect all towns and hit the submit button. Click \u201cAll years\u201d and hit\nsubmit again. Now you can download the CSV, which stands for\ncomma-separated values. It\u2019s essentially a spreadsheet without any of\nthe fancy highlighting or formatting of Excel. It\u2019s a universal format,\nand when given the option, it\u2019s a good idea to get your data in CSV.\nBecause of its simple structure, it\u2019s easy for a human to read and just\nabout any computer can understand\u00a0it.\nNow, we have our data, but if we want to visualize it, we need a map to\nput it on. We can get this map from a SHP (pronounced \u201cshape\u201d) file.\n\u00a0Luckily, in many states, the government or academic institutions often\nhave a clearing house for this kind of geographic data. In Connecticut,\nyou can find it at the U. Conn. library. Point your browser toward\nhttp://magic.lib.uconn.edu/, then look under the \u201cCT GIS\u201d column and\nclick on the \u201cBoundaries\u201c\u00a0section.\nGrab the \u201cConnecticut Towns\u201d shapefile from 2010. Then you have to\nconvert the file to a format that Fusion Tables can use. Luckily, there\nis a free website called \u201cShp Escape\u201d that can help. Give it your\nshp file and log into your Google account and it will automatically\ntransform the file and ship it into your Fusion Tables account. Some\ntimes the site can be a little busy, so it may take a few minutes. Be\u00a0patient.\nNow, that you have your map file in Fusion Tables, you need the data you\nwant to visualize. Go to Google Drive, click the \u201ccreate\u201d button and\nchoose Fusion Table. Choose the \u201cdownload.csv\u201d file that you got from\nData Haven and put this into your Fusion Table. (Notice, Fusion Tables\nalso allows you to import tabular data directly from a Google\u00a0Spreadsheeet.\nClean up the column headings in the file to make the more meaningful.\nNow we\u2019re going to merge the data file back to the shape file we already\nuploaded. Under the \u201cFile\u201d dropdown menu, choose \u201cMerge.\u201d Find your\nConnecticut Towns shape table. And you have to determine which field to\njoin the tables on. What field is the same in both tables? Notice that\nthe \u201ctown\u201d field in the crime table matches the \u201cNAME10\u201d field in the\nshape file. That\u2019s your key to join the tables together. Just be certain\nthat each town name only appears once in that column in each table (in\nthis example, it\u00a0does).\nOnce it sends you into Fusion Tables, click the \u201cAbout this table\u201d link\nunder the File dropdown menu and \u201cedit table information.\u201d Update the\nname of the table, give it a meaningful description, attribution and a\nlink to the original download. This can help you later to retrace your\nsteps and bulletproof your reporting. It will also help others who look\nat your work and want to see your primary source material. Click on the\n\u201cShare\u201d button and make the map\u00a0public.\nWe have both tables combined together into one, new, merged table. But\nif you click on the \u201cMap\u201d tab, it probably still doesn\u2019t look right. We\nneed to style the representation of the data. While you\u2019re on the map\ntab, go to the \u201cTools\u201d dropdown and click on \u201cChange Map Styles.\u201d This\nwill allow us to choose how we want to color code the towns based on\ntheir crime rate. Instead of points, we want to click on \u201cFill color\u201d\nunder the \u201cPolygons\u201d section. Points would be if we were color-coding\npins on individual addresses. Instead, we want to shade an entire town\nbased on its crime rate, thus we want \u201cpolygon.\u201d For the fill color,\nlet\u2019s pick the \u201cbuckets\u201d tab, which means we can choose four different\ncolors to represent the range of crime rates in our area. If you want to\nfancy, you can choose whatever color you want for each bucket. Hit the\n\u201csave\u201d button. Are all of your towns filled in with a color? (You can\nignore the \u201cSouthwick Jog\u201c). If not, then you probably haven\u2019t set\nthe range of values for your crime rate to the include all of them.\nAdjust the high and low ends of your range until none of your towns are\nblank. This may take some\u00a0jiggering.\nPlay with the bucket sizes and colors of the buckets. What makes sense?\nIs everything in\u00a0there?\nClick on the title to change the attribution and background info for the\nmerged table. Share the merged table and make it public. Then click\nTools> Publish. This gives you the embed code for you to put it in your\u00a0story.\nOnce you get the hang of this, you can but producing web-ready\ninteractive maps in 20-30 minutes, a task that would have taken hours or\ndays not all that long ago. This is an awesome\u00a0tool.\n\nThere are a few more things that you can tweak, if you like. You can go\nto Tools>Change info window layout, to tweak the information that\u2019s\ndisplayed when you click on a\u00a0polygon.\nAnd one last tip, you don\u2019t always have to upload your own data or map\nfiles. You can go to Help>Search Public Tables and browse through all\nof the data that other Fusion Tables users have uploaded. Of course, as\nwith all reporting, the caveat is to mindful of the source. Always\nconfirm the information and data with other parties. But if you find a\ngood shapefile, you could use it again and again. It\u2019s definitely worth\u00a0exploring.\nThat\u2019s the super fast and dirty introduction to Fusion Tables. Now, go\nexplore it some more on your own.

            "text": "This is another in the series of \u201cBest Practices\u201d posts from my\narchives from the Herald News. This was also written by Jonathan\nMaslow, and offers some solid street reporting tips for counting the\ncrowd at any large public event.\n\nNews reporting often involves telling how many people took part in or\nattended an event. Sometimes the seating capacity is known, as in the\ncase of a sports stadium. Sometimes an official estimates the crowd\nsize, sometimes the organizers estimate. Sometimes they don\u2019t agree.\nSometimes no one\u00a0estimates.\nIt\u2019s a good practice for the reporter to do his or her own estimation in\nall\u00a0cases.\nFor inside events, a quick head count with a qualifying \u201cabout\u201d is good.\n(\u201cabout 75 people attended the planning board session.\u201d) The tried and\ntrue method of estimating crowd size is as follows:\n1) make a careful measurement of the area in which the event takes\nplace. Simply put, that\u2019s length times width equals square feet.\nIn some cases, it may take a slightly more sophisticated algorithm (the\ncrowd covers the sidewalks on six blocks. Ask officials how long each\nblock is, walk off the width of sidewalk.\u00a0Multiply).\n\u200b2) Decide whether it\u2019s a dense crowd or a loose crowd. People packed\ninto a subway car, for example, are a dense crowd and occupy 2 square\nfeet per person. A loose crowd, such as a parade of journalists on May\nDay, has one person per five square\u00a0feet.\n\u200b3) Divide the area by the crowd density, and you\u2019ve got your estimated\ncrowd.\nExample: A political rally takes place in the square outside City Hall.\nYou pace it off and find it\u2019s 150 feet long and 100 feet wide, or 15,000\nsquare feet. You wade into the crowd to test the density. Some places\ntoward the front are packed, but in the back it\u2019s loose. You choose a\ndensity in between of one person per three square feet. Divide 15,000 by\n3 = 5,000\u00a0people.\nTo\u00a0recap:\n\narea: 150 x 100 = 15,000\n estimate of density: 3 sq. feet/per person\n 15,000 divided by 3 = 5,000\u00a0attendees\n\nIf AP is covering an event, check your estimate against theirs, which is\nbased on aerial/satellite photography and should be accurate. If yours\nand theirs are at great odds, dig in your heels and insist the wire\nservices are an\u00a0ass.\nNote: [Then] Passaic County Sherriff\u2019s communications man Bill Maer says\nthe county uses a slight\u00a0variation:\n\n\u200b1) Count how many people are actually in a 10 x 10 foot area (that\u2019s\n100 square\u00a0feet).\n\u200b2) Measure on foot or get a good estimate of the size of the entire\u00a0area.\n\u200b3) divide the total area by 100 (the number of 10 by 10\u00a0squares)\n\u200b4) Multiply the result by how many people are in the sample 10 x 10\nfoot\u00a0square.\n\nPersonally, I think this adds an unnecessary step, but it does make the\nreckoning of density a bit more accurate and hence, perhaps, the crowd\nestimate\u00a0itself.\n\nJonathan Maslow, Herald News, Nov.\u00a02003\n",

            "text": "It seems odd in 2012 that in some newsrooms the data journalists don\u2019t\nget the same kind of credit for their work that other reporters receive.\nI suppose it\u2019s understandable, if NICAR-L is any indication, because to\nsome of our colleagues data work is a mysterious and opaque contribution\nto a story and thus they don\u2019t quite know how or when to give us a\u00a0byline.\nThis is the policy we used when I was the CAR reporter at the Herald\nNews, and it was heavily modeled (in some parts verbatim) on the one\nadopted by Rob Gebeloff, then of The Star-Ledger and now at the New\nYork Times. This slightly updated policy also guides us today at The\nStar-Ledger as we decide when our work merits a byline. It\u2019s a good\nplace for newsrooms to start the conversation about the work of their\ndata\u00a0people.\n\nThe data journalist is available every day for assistance, large and\n    small, on daily, breaking and enterprise stories. The reporter is\n    here to help locate data. When another reporter or editor asks for a\n    quick fact here or there (such as a basic Census figure), no credit\n    is necessary. It\u2019s part of the\u00a0job.\nMany times, the quick fact search turns into an analysis of data.\n    When this analysis produces \u201cproprietary information\u201d that supports\n    a story, the data journalist should receive a tagline on the story.\n    For example, a colleague wants a complete breakdown of Census data\n    for a particular neighborhood\u2014a task that would require the reporter\n    to assemble the data piecemeal from several tables or sources\u2014this\n    would create proprietary information unique to our news gathering.\n    If this information is even just a few paragraphs of the story, a\n    tagline is\u00a0appropriate.\n\nIf the data journalist does a significant analysis of data that\n    creates proprietary information that becomes the thesis of a story,\n    he or she will receive a byline.Even if the data journalist\n    does not write another word in the published piece, his or her\n    reporting forms the basis of a story and thus warrants a\n    byline. \n   For example, the journalist analyzes a new set of data released by a\n    government agency and finds that homeowners in suburban Passaic\n    County are scooping up flood insurance hand over fist. The reporter\n    assembles the analyzed data and passes it on to the real estate\n    reporter who finds additional sources for quotes and writes the\n    story. The nut graf of the story should say \u201ca Herald News analysis\n    of TK data has found\u2026\u201d and the data journalist shares the byline\n    with the other\u00a0reporter.\n\n\nTom Meagher, Herald News, July 2006, via Rob Gebeloff at The\u00a0Star-Ledger\n\n",

In many elections, we\u2019ll have hundreds of races spread\nacross a dozen counties. And none of the officials overseeing those\nelections provides a useful electronic feed of\u00a0results.\nWe\u2019ve tried off-the-shelf products to input election data into tables\nwith disastrous, near-comical results. Without a single developer in our\nnewsroom, we\u2019ve cobbled together solutions and written hundreds of lines\nof code to reverse engineer our hand-collected data and take it from our\nwebsite into our print pagination system. For something that\u2019s over in\njust a few hours, we invest an incredible amount of time and effort into\ngetting it right, often without being really satisfied with the\u00a0product.\nAll of that struggle has led us here, to our proposal for the Knight\nFoundation\u2019s News Innovation Challenge for a project we\u2019re calling\nVOTER.\nVOTER is a browser-based program that will help organizations streamline\nthe collection of election results and create embeddable online graphics\nthat will work on any website, especially the common blogging platforms\nthat power many news operations. It is still very early in the\ndevelopment process, but we\u2019re excited about the News Challenge and even\nmore psyched about the possibility that we can turn our trauma into\nsomething that will save newsrooms everywhere a whole lot of\u00a0heartache.\nWhat do you think?

This first one was written by Jonathan\nMaslow, and his tips for being transparent in our reporting and\nwriting continue to ring\u00a0true.\nOur credibility as journalists and as a newspaper is the most important\nequity we have in the marketplace of ideas. The more readers trust us,\nthe better our performance. We have to earn that trust every single day.\nOne of the most important ways to do this is leveling with our readers:\ntelling them what we know, how we know it, what we don\u2019t know, why we\ndon\u2019t know it and what\u2019s what. In practice this entails the highest\ndegree of transparency possible in our publication.Work toward greater\u00a0transparency:\n\u200b1) Don\u2019t use hearsay. Don\u2019t describe things you didn\u2019t see, but rather\nattribute it to a firsthand witness and tell the reader who that witness\nwas. If you are writing about a public meeting you did not attend, be\naware that readers must not be given a false impression. You don\u2019t need\nto say you weren\u2019t there. But you can\u2019t report things as if you were\u00a0there.\n\u200b2) Don\u2019t just use the boilerplate \u201csources said,\u201d but give the reader\nas much information as you can without breaching trust, for example:\n\u201ctwo sources in the AG\u2019s office familiar with the case,\u201d or \u201ca high\nofficial in the department who asked her name not be used because she\nfeared political\u00a0retribution.\u201d\n\u200b3) Don\u2019t just use the cliche \u201cthe mayor could not be reached for\ncomment.\u201d Use instead: \u201cthe mayor did not return repeated phone calls\nfor comment over a three-day period, although City Hall said he was not\non vacation or out of town on\u00a0business.\u201d\n\u200b4) As you know, we sometimes have problems getting information from\npolice on weekends. Don\u2019t just let this go with \u201cpolice did not release\ninformation.\u201d Tell the readers, e.g., \u201cSgt. Troy Anthony said he could\nnot release any information about the incident, because Mayor Sammy\nTorres, who is also acting public safety director, has told the police\ndepartment that all news releases must go through his office. The mayor\ndid not return five phone calls\u00a0Sunday.\u201d\nTransparency is a habit, a muscle. Flex it and it gets stronger. And\nyour work gets more accurate, better, more useful to\u00a0readers.\n\nJonathan Maslow, Herald News, June,\u00a02004\n",

Assume any data you get is dirty\nand full of holes.\n\nGovernment data is hardly unique in this respect, but it is our bread\nand butter, and frankly we should expect better from the government, so\nI\u2019ll pick on it today.\n\n\nWhy is so much public data such a\u00a0mess?\n\n\u200b1. Much like journalists, government agencies are not nearly as good\nwith numbers as they ought to\u00a0be.\n\n\n2. When databases exist, they are often built on things never\nintended to be turned into relational data, like hand-written accident\nreports.\n\n3. Many agencies seem to subscribe to the[infinite monkey\ntheorem][].\n\n\n![][2]\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with it, the infinite monkey theorem more or less\nsays that given an infinite amount of time and an infinite number of\nmonkeys with typewriters, eventually the monkeys will write the complete\nworks of Shakespeare or \u201cA Tale of Two Cities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWhen you work with a lot of public data, this is what feels like.\nOccasionally there\u2019s something correct, but before you find it, you have\nto wade through what seems like a near-infinite number of errors.\n I\u2019m not suggesting that government employees are\nprimates, but I am pretty certain that they\u2019re outsourcing their data\nentry to monkeys\u2026 and it gets worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause these monkeys are not\u00a0geniuses.\n\n\n\n\nThey are enemies of good data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese monkeys are mean, and they hate puppies and clean data (and\nwater). To be fair, in my completely unscientific survey, the data has\ngotten better in the past decade, but it\u2019s not where it should be.\n\n\n\nEvery data entry mistake possible will be made. Often you fill find new\nmistakes that you never, ever would have considered or imagined in your\nwildest dreams.\n\n\n\n\nThese clerical errors will make your life miserable. You can\neither welcome our new monkey overlords or you can arm yourself.\n\nThe old\u00a0tools\n\n-   Excel: filters, pivot tables, string functions\n-   Access: Group by queries\n-   Notepad++: Regular expressions\n-   Scripting language for automated, repetitive cleaning\n\n\n\nWith these, the cleaning of the database could take days or weeks or\nlonger.\n\n\n\nNow you can do it with Google Refine in a few hours or less.\n\n\n\n\nIt can take that crap and turn it into a diamond.\n\n\nWhat is Refine good\u00a0at?\n\n- Transforming data, either on individual cells or whole columns at a\ntime\n\n\n\n- Clustering data to find similar values that repeat for exploration and\ncleaning\n\n\n- And many, many other tasks.\n\nRefine does a lot of really amazing things, and this class will give you\njust a tiny taste. It can help high-level programmers with repetitive\ntasks, and it has its own expression language for accessing and\nscrubbing data.\u00a0But it is also a great tool for the less technical set.\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with Microsoft Excel, you should be right at home\nwith Refine. You don\u2019t have to be a comp sci PhD to love\u00a0it.\n\nThe two big areas we\u2019re going to concentrate on today are clustering\ndata and transforming it\n\n\nSo let\u2019s get started.\u00a0Here are instructionsto install Refine on your\u00a0computer.\nWe\u2019ll start with a dataset of lottery winners from New Jersey. Say you\nwant to know what areas spend the most on lottery tickets but win the\u00a0least.\nDownload the lottery dataset here.\nRefine runs through your web browser, but don\u2019t worry, it works offline\nas\u00a0well.\nYou can import a table file in many formats, either from your computer,\nfrom Google Docs or from a URL for a file on the web. Once you have\nRefine running, click \u201cCreate\u00a0Project.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll see a preview of what the data looks like. When you pull in the\nCSV of lottery data, make sure to uncheck the \u201cParse cell data\u2026\u201d\u00a0option.\n\n\nNew Jersey zip codes start with zero. If Refine guesses that column is a\nnumber, it will drop the leading zero, so unchecking the option will\npreserve the zips as text.\n\nWith this data, we\u2019re going to use Refine to clean up the W\\_TOWN column\nto standardize the names of municipalities. But we never want to work\nwith the raw data, so let\u2019s copy the column that we\u2019ll actually\ntransform into something usable. So click on the arrow at the top of the\nW\\_TOWN column and choose the Edit Column\\>Add column based on this\ncolumn option.\n\nEnter a name for the new column. We\u2019ll use \u201cTOWN.\u201d Original, I know.\n\n\n\n\nNow, initially Refine will only display 10 rows, but there are 3,100 in\nthis dataset, so let\u2019s look at a for more. Click the number 50 next to\n\u201cShow as\u201d to see more.\n\n\n\nIn Excel, one of the first things you\u2019d do with a dataset is sort it. So\nclick on the arrow at the top of the TOWN column and choose \u201cSort\u201d from\nthe options. Now, \u00a0you can filter out just a few records. Click on the\narrow and choose \u201cText Filter\u201d from the options. You\u2019ll see a box pop up\nin the left column. Type in Atlantic and see how it plucks out only the\ntowns with \u201cAtlantic\u201d in the name: Atlantic City, Atlantic Highlands,\nAtlantic High and West Atlantic City. As you might guess, not all of\nthese are real towns.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s lose the filter. Click on the X in the upper left corner of the\nfilter box. Now, we\u2019re going to add a Facet\\> Text facet. Dan Nguyen\nat\u00a0ProPublica calls Refine\u2019s faceting \u201cthe better way to filter.\u201d He\u2019s\ntotally right.\n\n\n\nThe facet will create a box in the left column with the total number of\nchoices and a list of all the possible choices in this column and the\nnumber of each. You\u2019ll see there are 608 options. At the top is\n\u201cABERDEEN\u201d with 3 occurrences. Scroll to the bottom and click on \u201cFacet\nby choice counts.\u201d This will create another box that will let you\ndisplay only the choices that occur a certain number of times. It shows\nthe range of values in a column and helps you to spot anomalies or\noutliers. For instance, if you move the boundaries to only show the\nchoices with between 120 and 140 uses, you\u2019ll only see \u201cJERSEY CITY\u201d and\n\u201cNEWARK\u201d rows. Close the \u201cFacet by choice counts\u201d box.\n\n\n\nScroll through the text facet box a little ways into the Bs. See the\noption for \u201cBELEE MEAD\u201d? It has one occurrence. Notice that two lines\nlater appears \u201cBELLE MEAD,\u201d the actual name of the town. If you hover\nover \u201cBELEE MEAD,\u201d you will see the option to \u201cedit\u201d appear to the\nright. Click on that and then fix the spelling of the name in the box\nthat appears. Notice that the choice count drops to 607.\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at another way to clean data. Scroll down a few more lines.\nNotice that there are two lines in a row for \u201cBERKELEY HEIGHTS.\u201d They\u2019re\nspelled the same, so why are they listed separately? Because one of them\nhas an extra space at the end of it that screws up the grouping. This is\nthe kind of thing that back in the bad old days would make you throw\nyour PC out the window two weeks into a data project. Instead, let\u2019s get\nrid of all the extra, invisible spaces. Click at the top of the TOWN\ncolumn, edit cells\\> common transforms\\> Trim leading and trailing\nwhitespace. Notice again how the choice count dropped. We\u2019re down to 573\ntown names now. We\u2019re getting there.\n\n\n\nSo you could spend hours scrolling through and eyeballing similar names\nand editing them by hand using these methods, or we could unleash the\nreal power of Refine: clustering.\n\n\n\nClick on the \u201cCluster\u201d button in the facet box. Click it and you\u2019ll see\nsomething like this. The default method is \u201ckey collision.\u201d That should\nonly show a couple of options. Try changing it to \u201cnearest neighbor.\u201d I\ncan\u2019t exactly explain the algorithm behind it, but it\u2019s obvious that it\nfinds town names with similar names that should probably have the same\nname. You see similar sets like \u201cPOMPTON LAKES\u201d and \u201cPOMPTON LAKE\u201d or\n\u201cE. ORANGE,\u201d \u201cE ORANGE\u201d and \u201cE.ORANGE.\u201d Click the \u201cmerge\u201d button next to\neach grouping and type the name you want them all to be changed to in\nthe \u201cNew Cell Value\u201d column and hit the \u201cMerge selected and recluster\u201d\nbutton at the bottom. You\u2019ve just cleaned those messy columns to a\nsingle value.\n\n\n\n![cluster][]\n\n\nScroll through the list, reclustering and editing whole chunks at a\ntime. This is a huge time saver. When you\u2019re done with the \u201cnearest\nneighbor\u201d clusters, experiment with \u201ckey collision\u201d and see if it picks\nup any other similar\u00a0names.\nNow, keep in mind that to get this right, you\u2019ll have to do some\nadditional reporting. You\u2019ll need to be certain that \u201cNORTH BRUNSWICK\u201d\nand \u201cNPRTH BRUNSWICK\u201d are indeed the same place and not separate values\nas they came to you. If you\u2019re confident in your reporting, Refine makes\nthe data cleaning\u00a0easy.\nWhen you\u2019re satisfied that you\u2019re done, click on \u201cExport\u201d on the upper\nright corner. You can output the file as html, TSV, CSV, Excel or any\nnumber of formats. Pull it into your favorite spreadsheet program and\nrun your analysis. Then run it all again to make sure you got it right.\nTo be certain, start from scratch and triple-check\u00a0it.\n\n\nAs cool as this is, Refine has a few more tricks for the beginner. Let\u2019s\nlook at this file of\u00a0[NJ hospital report cards][].\n\n\n\nCreate a new project and import it into Refine.\n\n\n\nAnything look weird? How about that first column. Seems like it\u00a0includes\ninformation we\u2019d probably want to split into several columns.\u00a0In Excel\nyou\u2019d do this with a series of nested functions. In Refine, we can do it\nwith a single click. At the top of the \u201cHospital\u201d column, choose the\ndrop-down menu and Edit column\\>Split into several columns\u2026\n\n\n\nWhen the wizard menu pops up, choose \u00a0a semicolon as the separator and\nuncheck \u201cremove this column,\u201d because we always want to be compare\nagainst our original data, right?\n\n\n\n\nSo this looks better, with the name, street, town, state and zip code in\nseparate columns. But something isn\u2019t quite right. What about the zip\ncode? Why is it only four digits? Oh yeah, New Jersey zip codes start\nwith zeroes. Refine assumed that column was an integer and lopped off\nthe zero at the front.\n\n\n\nAnother great feature of Refine is that it logs everything you do with\nthe dataset. When you make a mistake or you want track back through your\nwork, click on the \u201cUndo/Redo\u201d tab at the top of the left column and you\ncan tiptoe back through your process.\n\n\n\nLook at the list and click on the item at the top, \u201c0. Create project\u201d\nto jump back to that step.\n\n![undo][]\n\nNow, redo the \u201cSplit into several columns\u2026\u201d step and this time uncheck\n\u201cGuess cell type\u201d to preserve the zips as text.\n\nBe sure to make note of the undo option at the top of the screen. You\ncan move a single step back at any time by clicking on this, much like\nthe undo prompt that appears in Gmail after you archive or delete a\nmessage.\n\n\n\nFinally, notice that the names of the hospital are inconsistent.\u00a0Some\nare all uppercase. Others are only upper-cased. Let\u2019s standardize them.\n\nClick on the arrow at the top of the Hospital column and choose Edit\ncells\\> Common transforms \\> To titlecase.\n\n\n\nVoila. A cleaned dataset. You\u2019re\u00a0welcome.\n\nLet\u2019s try one last dataset, this one looking at contributions from\nNassau County, N.Y. police unions to political\u00a0candidates.\n\nImport the data into Refine and let\u2019s start by trying to clean up the\ntown\u00a0names.\nAdd a text facet to the City column. Click Edit cells> Common\ntransforms> trim leading and trailing\u00a0whitespace\n\nSee the count change from 240 to 238.\n\nNow, let\u2019s cluster the city names to see if we can consolidate any\nentries.\n\n\n\n\nHow do you see the count change in the city column?\n\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn our attention to the Name column. For this exercise,\nlet\u2019s start by adding a filter on the city and just looking at \u201cAlbany.\u201d\nYou can also do this by clicking on Albany in the text facet box.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind \u00a0that any changes we make from here on out will only affect\nthe \u201cAlbany\u201d subset of the data until we clear this filter (or facet).\nNow, add a text facet to the \u201cName\u201d column. Browse the first few\nentries. Notice there are a lot of very, very similar names here.\n\n\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s say we\u2019re interested in looking at how\nmuch Sen. Joe Bruno got from Nassau police groups. There appear to be 10\ngroups here with similar names receiving donations for Bruno. Seems like\na good chance that many of these are the same organization. For the sake\nof argument, let\u2019s say your reporting shows that yes, these are the same\ngroup and we want them to all have the same name for our analysis. Hover\nyour cursor over each one and when the option to \u201cinclude\u201d appears on\nthe right, click it. Once you\u2019ve \u201cincluded\u201d them all, click the cluster\nbutton.\n\n\n\n\nThis will attempt to cluster the choices just in this selection to offer\nsuggestions on names that could b the same. Change the method to\n\u201cnearest neighbor\u201d and the distance function to \u201cPPM.\u201d If you merge all\nof the offered suggestions under the same name, it will condense six of\nthe 10 choices into one name. Then you can merge and re-cluster. Once\nyou clean up all the suggestions, you can browse the data in the facet\none last time and clean up any stragglers individually as needed.\nBelieve it or not, Refine has just saved you a massive amount of time\nand energy.\n\n\nWhat did we learn here\u00a0today?\n\nRefine is a huge time saver and allows you to do commonly tedious data\ncleaning tasks with a few clicks of the mouse. We saw how to:  \n- Import and export data.  \n- Copy and edit columns, trimming whitespaces or changing the\ncapitalization.  \n- Use facets to filter and edit data  \n- Cluster a column to standardize spellings and\u00a0entries.\n\n\nThis has been a whirlwind sprint through this program, but hopefully\nit\u2019s given you a taste of what it can do.\n\n\n\n\nIn an ideal world, we\u2019d get all of our data handed to us perfectly clean\nin easy to access, user-friendly, real time feeds that make for simple\nanalysis and display.\n\n\n\nBut until then, we\u2019re going to have to wrestle with the murky and messy\ndatasets produced by those infinite monkeys making an infinite number of\nmistakes. Use Refine as your new big gun and never give up the fight.\n\n\nAnd remember, if you let the monkeys who enter data into government\nspreadsheets win, this is where it will\u00a0lead.\n\n\nThey\u2019ll make a monkey out of you too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, if you want to keep messing with Refine, here are a pair of\ntutorials that put it much better than I can.\n\n\n\nDavid Huynh, Refine\u2019s creator:\n",

            "text": "About six months ago now, I started a new job, taking over as The\nStar-Ledger\u2019s Computer-Assisted Reporting Editor. For anyone who follows\nme on Twitter, this may help explain why many of my online comments\nlately have dealt with statistics, data visualizations and\u00a0programming.\nIn a slight departure from my day-to-day role working with numbers, I\nwas asked to fill in for one of my bosses at a symposium hosted by John\nJay College\u2019s Center on Media, Crime and Justice. The round table\ndiscussion brought together police and journalists from across New\nJersey to talk about working together and how using social media tools\ncan help all of us do our\u00a0jobs.\nIt was an interesting day to say the least. I sat in a room with 45\ncops, reporters and editors who often have an adversarial relationship.\nI met cops who my reporters have been interviewing for years, as well as\ncompetitors whose bylines I knew well. It was refreshing to step out of\nthe daily grind for a few hours and talk about our shared frustrations\nand how we can do things better, particularly with the explosion of\nsocial media tools at our\u00a0fingertips.\n\nAfter the jump, some of my prepared remarks, without the slight\ndiversions I took when I delivered them.\n\nWhat the public and the news media want from the police on the\u00a0internet\n\u200b1. Speed. Like news organizations and police departments everywhere, we\nhave seen our resources dwindle. At the same time, competition has grown\nexponentially. We want the information fast. We want to know what\u2019s\nhappening before it happens and then we want to be able to alert our\u00a0readers.\nIt can buy police departments time. If you get a tweet out quickly to\nalert the public or confirm or deny an event, then you can avoid calls\nfrom dozens of media outlets hounding you in the short term. It\u2019ll give\nyou breathing room to gather the facts on the investigation before\nresponding to follow-up questions or releasing more details. We know the\nscanner chatter is often wrong, but often we can\u2019t afford not to chase a\nstory unless the police confirm that it\u2019s\u00a0wrong.\nA tweet is a starting point. It can be a great way to immediately alert\na lot of people to a major news issue (a high-profile arrest) or a\npublic safety or infrastructure concern (tunnel closing, fire or\ntornado). But there needs to\u00a0be\u2026.\n\u200b2. Interaction. The nature of the internet has changed communication.\nIt is not a one-way platform. For it to have any relevance, you have to\u00a0interact.\nPeople will come to you looking for answers. if you don\u2019t provide them,\nlots of other people on the internet will try to fill in the gaps, often\nwith misinformation. A tweet from a passerby that says something like,\n\u201cI drove by a fire on Main St., and it looks like a plane hit a house.\nIt\u2019s carnage everywhere.\u201d could have just been a small kitchen fire that\nsent lots of smoke into a residential street. There is no replacement\nfor an investigation from the\u00a0authorities.\nThis will inevitably raise a number of questions in departments large\nand small:\u00a0Who is in charge of the Twitter feed? Who is empowered to\npost on it? Is there a policy for replying to tweets or Facebook\ncomments?\u00a0It can be time consuming to keep up to date. But a social\nmedia presence isn\u2019t particularly useful as simply an archive of static\npress releases. (As I learned at the event, the [International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police Center on Social Media][] has drafted a\nmodel policy for law enforcement agencies on how to adopt social\nmedia\u00a0tools).\nBeing on the internet has to be faster than telling reporters that they\nhave to wait three days to talk to the designated PIO about a homicide\n(which we hear far more often than one would expect). And posting a\nsingle statement online isn\u2019t sufficient. It\u2019s a good place to start so\nwe know what kind of story we\u2019re dealing with, but we need to be able to\nfollow up. We need to be able to ask questions to clarify statements and\nprobe for more detail. You don\u2019t have to answer all of the questions,\nbut we need to be able to ask\u00a0them.\nWe don\u2019t want to ever have to attribute information to an agency\u2019s\nwebsite or Twitter feed. We use these as planning tools. Then we want to\nconfirm the information with a real person in the department to make\nsure we got it\u00a0right.\nAnd the police can use these social media platforms to their\nadvantage.\u00a0The LAPD used Twitter to seek information in a hit and run of\na valet at a restaurant, for instance. They later arrested an elderly\nman in the case, although it\u2019s not clear if the tip that led to his\narrest came from a Twitter\u00a0user.\nThe NJ State Police has used Twitter to dispel rumors and bad\ninformation from scanner reports about a plane crash in South Jersey or\nSEALs training in the Delaware River. They\u2019ve also used it to get out\ninitial information on fatal accidents and crimes before being bombarded\nby\u00a0reporters.\n\u200b3. The internet is just a tool. If your department or PIO refuses to\nshare public information with the public, then there\u2019s no point in being\nonline. You have to have information that people want for it to be\nworthwhile. Posting about park closures or issues of minor significance\nare not good enough. Users on social media, particularly Twitter and\nFacebook are voracious news consumers. They want substance and lots of\nit. If you\u2019re not answering phone calls from reporters who need\ninformation, there\u2019s no reason you\u2019d do it\u00a0online.\nThe benefit of encouraging an air of transparency in your department\nhowever is that it can help demystify the process of police work and\nhumanize law enforcement\u00a0officers.\n\u200b4. Facebook and Twitter can also be investigative tools. When we\nbackground a subject of a story, a crime or otherwise, these sites are\namong the\u00a0first things we look\u00a0at.\nIn several cases in New Jersey lately, it\u2019s been a key component of\ncriminal charges against young people. In the Tyler Clementi case,\nhis former roommate is charged with trying to doctor his Twitter account\nto remove incriminating information. In the case of a group of Old\nBridge teens accused of beating a man to death, they allegedly held\nextensive conversations on Facebook about the night in question and\nthe\u00a0beating.\nAnd it helps us track people down, like the Hoboken woman who shot the\namazing picture of the Space Shuttle from the window of her airplane.\nWe found her on\u00a0Facebook.  \n\nMy talk went well, although it was a bit disconcerting to notice that\none of my fellow panelists, Capt. Mike Parker of the Los Angeles\nCounty Sheriff\u2019s Department, was looking up my resume on his laptop\nas I spoke. Even though I post all these things to the whole world on\nthe internet, it\u2019s easy to forget sometimes that anyone actually looks\nat\u00a0it.\nThe rest of the day\u2019s discussions offered a good opportunity to see some\nof these sources in a less-heated environment and learn from the other\nattendees and panelists (including Ted Gest of\u00a0Criminal Justice\nJournalists and Nancy Kolb of the\u00a0International Association of\nChiefs of Police)\u00a0about some of the resources we all have at our\nfingertips. I found out about The Crime Report, put together by\nCriminal Justice Journalists and The Center on Media, Crime and Justice.\nI also heard about IACP\u2019s handy directory of police agencies with a\npresence on social media.\nProbably the best reminder I heard all day though came from one of the\nother panelists, Capt. Jeff Paul, public information officer for the\nMorris County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. \u00a0He bristled at receiving calls from\nreporters asking for information, in some cases demanding answers,\nwithout ever coming to introduce themselves to\u00a0him.\nEven with all of this magic from the interwebs to help us communicate\nfaster and easier, there really is no replacement for building a\npersonal relationship, face-to-face, with a police source, before you\u2019re\non deadline in the middle of a\u00a0catastrophe.\nLeave a comment below or follow me on Twitter@ultracasualand\ntell me about your experience working with police or journalists on\nsocial media\u00a0networks.\n[International Association of Chiefs of Police Center on Social\n  Media]:\u00a0http://www.iacpsocialmedia.org/",

My former colleague, health reporter Betsy Querna,\nrecommends the Association of Health Care Journalists\u2019 primer on the\nfederal\u00a0law:\n\n\u2026there are a number of public policy exceptions under the Privacy\nRule that permit the disclosure of protected health information\nwithout an individual\u2019s authorization. For example, covered entities\nmay disclose information for treatment purposes, for certain law\nenforcement or public health oversight purposes, or in accordance with\na court order. (This list is not\u00a0exhaustive.)\nAdditionally, the following are NOT protected health information:\npolice and fire incident reports, and court records. Also, birth\nrecords and autopsy records are not protected health information to\nthe extent they are maintained by state agencies. In addition, if a\nstate FOIA law designates death records and/or autopsy reports as\npublic information that must be disclosed, covered entities may\ndisclose that protected health information without an\u00a0authorization.\nHospitals may maintain directories of patients, although patients can\nask to be kept out of the directory and health care professionals use\ntheir professional judgment with regard to what directory information\n(if any) to include about incapacitated individuals. When someone\ncalls and asks about a patient by name whose information is in the\ndirectory, the hospital may reveal where the patient is located in the\nhospital and information about the patient\u2019s general condition\n(including whether the patient has died, or whether the patient has\nbeen treated and released).\nTo release additional information to a reporter, a hospital must\nobtain written authorization from the patient (or the patient\u2019s parent\nor guardian in the case of minors). That document does not have to be\nnotarized or witnessed. The American Hospital Association\u2019s Web\nsite, http://www.aha.org, provides a checklist of what should be\nincluded in an authorization form, along with other guidance on\u00a0HIPAA.\n\nAssociation of Health Care\u00a0Journalists\n\n",

            "text": "Story tips short and\u00a0long\n1.Write tight. Maybe the most important thing you can do to increase\nyour productivity without doing more work is to write tight and trim\nyour own work. Write briefs instead of 8 inchers. Write 8 inchers\ninstead of 10 inchers. Write 10-12s instead of 12-15s. Write 12-15s\ninstead of 15-18s. The tighter you write, the less time it takes and the\nmore time you free up for other stuff. Time is a gift to the news\nreporter. Use that extra hour or half hour to stop in on your beat, talk\nto a couple sources on the phone, read online what other newspapers are\ndoing, or skim-read documents or\u00a0reports.\n\u200b2. Prewrite/outline. Whether you sweat over your copy or it flows from\nyour fingers like hot fudge, prewriting saves you time and energy. Take\nfive to 10 minutes before you start to think how am I going to handle my\nstory. Look at your notes and materials. Make yourself a thumbnail\noutline. What\u2019s your lede? What\u2019s your best quote(s)? What\u2019s the news\nimportant to readers? What\u2019s the background? What\u2019s the context? Once\nyou\u2019ve got a bijou outline, you\u2019ve got a roadmap. Drive, she\u00a0said.\n\u200b3. Demand coaching. Editors know they need to story conference and\ncoach writing and help with resources and ideas, but things get hectic\nand sometimes they don\u2019t. That does not mean you should not ask advice\nand coaching. The crucial times to talk to an editor are: before you\nstart reporting; after you finish reporting, but before you start\nwriting; when you\u2019ve got a top; and, of course, when you have to make a\nlate decision on whether the story holds up, reaching an alternate\nsource,\u00a0etc.\n4.Master the art of the weekbook. It can\u2019t be said too often or\nemphasized too much: the weekbook is the key to excellent and efficient\nperformance. At its basic level, the weekbook is a scheduling device. To\ntake your weekbook to a higher level of value requires the additional\ningredient: forethought. Here are several specific practices that can\nimprove your weekbook - as well as your editors\u2019 esteem and your job\u00a0satisfaction:\n\nBuild a good mix of stories every week. No one wants to do the same\n    thing day after day. Build concise dailies around news events,\n    meetings, issues. Build in patches (centerpieces) by thinking what\n    will make a good photo story. Build a weekend story every week by\n    giving yourself a couple hours early to midweek to report, a day or\n    three quarters day midweek to late week to write. Build in\n    overnights with a 2 p.m. deadline, freeing up an afternoon for\n    weekend story or enterprise work. Put in a strong daily Monday to\n    anchor the week and a timeless news feature, profile or human\n    interest story later in the week, that can be used on the\u00a0weekend.\nNews stories break like waves. It\u2019s coming (preview), it breaks\n    (hard news) and recedes (impact, folo, news feature, analysis,\n    preview of\n    next stage). Think of that wave shape. Ride the wave and you\u2019ll get\n    three or more hits off one news\u00a0event.\nAdd a line called FOLO beneath every budget line in your weekbook.\n    After you\u2019ve finished your story, go back and give yourself leads to\n    follow up: sources not reached, questions unanswered on deadline,\n    possible profiles of people in the news, impact of an event, stories\n    that ask why? And how? instead of just who, what, where and when.\n    Readers\u2019 surveys often indicate that one of the things readers\n    dislike is hit and miss coverage, especially one day wonders.\n    Readers want closure. They want the rest of the story. Use the FOLO\n    line to help fill your next\u00a0weekbook.\nMake your weekbook a living document. Go back and change it, add to\n    it, as the week goes along. It only takes a minute. Then re-mine\n    that weekbook in subsequent\u00a0weeks.\nIf you know you are going to be working on a weekend, start talking\n    to your weekend editor about your story early in the week. There\u2019s\n    nothing more awful than a reporter in panic on Thursday afternoon\n    with no idea what to cover on Saturday or\u00a0Sunday.\n\n\u200b4. Team up with colleagues. It\u2019s challenging, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s\nproductive. And\nit gives readers from various towns some sense of how news cuts across\nmunicipal\u00a0boundaries.\n\u200b5. Keep a tickler file, aka a futures file; fill it with clips,\nletters,\nnotes, pictures, labels and related junk of every variety from which\nstory\nideas will emerge. Review it now and\u00a0then.\n\u200b6. Don\u2019t fall into the rut of thinking there are no good stories on\nyour\nbeat. Instead, try to attack same-old stories from different,\nimaginative\nangles. Write more stories on how news impacts our towns and people.\nWrite local trend stories. Write community crime trend stories. Write\nservice pieces that inform readers about things they never thought they\nwanted to know and help readers make decisions. Write local business\npieces. Write local environmental stories. Write more people stories,\nand especially more profiles. People like to read about people. Put a\nhuman face on as many stories as you possibly\u00a0can.\n\u200b7. Remember listening posts for increasing the diversity of our\nsources and scope? Start doing them one day per period, as required. If\nyou can\u2019t do a full day, spend a few hours one day and a few hours\nanother day. Add new sources to your regular news coverage. Add new\nvoices to the mix of sources. The Herald News should never become a\ncity/town hall\u00a0newspaper!\n\u200b8. We can do the short-term investigation. We can do investigations\nthat depend more on human intelligence than massive data analysis. We\ncan reveal sides of life in our coverage area that no one knows. Try to\nrethink your investigative ambitions. Go for the clean, short, effective\nstrike. Go for the Wow! Factor: the story that makes readers say to\nthemselves, \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t know\u00a0that!\u201d\n\u200b9. Revisit stories. Many reporters know to keep a futures file. Many\nknow to revisit certain stories on a temporal basis (after one year,\nfive\nyears, 10 years etc.). This best practice adds another revisit\ncategory: the revisit to the incomplete story. Sometimes, try as we\nmight, we simply cannot get the full story by deadline time. Typically,\nan important source is missing or evasive. Or an agency delays an\nanswer. Or a document can\u2019t be obtained. There are many forms of this.\nWe go with what we\u2019ve got. But when there\u2019s a significant hole in the\narticle, we owe it to readers to revisit the story as soon as we can and\nfollow up with a second story or brief. This is especially true when the\nmissing information changes the way we covered the story previously.\nThis best practice speaks to both accuracy and thoroughness- two\nimportant parts of getting it right, which is our basic contract with\u00a0readers.\n\u200b10. Morgue. Many of you are checking the digital library for articles\ngoing back for years (to 1998) as part of your routine reporting. All\nof\nyou should be doing this every day. In addition, however, please don\u2019t\nforget that the library has a paper morgue going back donkey years.\nIt\u2019s a\ngood practice to check this, particularly when articles involve people\nwho\ndon\u2019t show up in the digital. Ask Mauro Margarelli to help you find\nthe\nfiles you\u00a0need.\n\u200b11. Eight Ways to Tell a Story. One of the most useful handouts Warren\nWatson of API left behind is the one put together by the York Daily\nRecord editor about the local kid who won a dance contest. She wrote the\nsame story in eight different ways, from inverted period to Q&A, to\nphoto package, blocks, narrative and beyond. This is a handy document\nthat all should have and refer to. If you don\u2019t have it, see Jonathan\nfor a copy. If you do have it, use it. God did not hand down the\ninverted pyramid on stone tablets. Many stories can be told better in\nother ways. Just as no one likes to eat the exact same thing three times\na day, readers, too, want variety. You can still present serious news\ninformation in entertaining ways. It just takes thought, creativity and\neffort. The reporter\u2019s job is always to make what she finds relevant\ninteresting for the\u00a0reader.\n\ncompiled from Best Practices written by Jonathan Maslow, Herald\nNews, from 2002 to\u00a02004\n\n\nNew story\u00a0forms\n1.Three Narrative Dailies.\nNarrative journalism is often associated, in journalists\u2019 minds, with\nlengthy enterprise projects. But there is no law saying narrative\ntechniques cannot be used in dailies or short form. At the recent\nNiemann Narrative Conference at Harvard, I jotted down three types of\ndaily stories that we could start doing to tell stories in new,\ninteresting and insightful ways for HN readers. Below, three generic\nbudget lines. Use them in good health, with one caveat: narrative\ndoesn\u2019t mean you can make it\u00a0up.\nTICKTOCK\nWe take a news event, breaking or second day reporting. Instead of\norganizing from the most important in the lead to the least important\nat the end, we reconstruct the event over time. What led up to that\nexplosion? What happened the night that cop was murdered? What did that\nfamily do on the day they died in a car crash? Exactly what steps did\nthe mayor take that allowed him to pass a zero increase budget? Or,\nalternatively, what is the aftermath of a particular news event? What\nhappened minute by minute after the plane crashed? What happened to the\nfreeholder in the days and weeks after he dropped out of third\u00a0grade?\nSECONDDRAFT\nJournalism is often called the first draft of history. But the first\ndraft\nis often abbreviated and cursory, sometimes underreported or skewed,\nand in some cases, wrong. In this story type, we take a second look at a\nbreaking story, going back to sources for a fuller or better account,\ntaking an unexpected angle or digging out some universal human truth\nfrom what at first ran as a brief or rushed deadline piece. The goal is\ntruth, not just\u00a0facts.\nEXPLAINER\nNarrative methods focusing on one person can often help readers\nunderstand complex, novel or unfamiliar issues and processes better than\nconventional reporting - which often overlooks the explanatory.\nBankruptcy. Identity theft. Outsourcing. Uninsured. Poverty level.\nDaycare. Drug addiction. Productivity. Deregulation. Bond rating. And on\nand on. In the explainer, we use one person\u2019s story to give readers\ninsight into a hard-to-get-at\u00a0topic.\n\u200b2. Three types of profiles.\nWe tend to think of profiles, if we think of them at all, as one thing:\nstories about people. It took Bill Blundell, former Page One editor at\nthe\nWall Street Journal has three types of\u00a0profiles:\n\u200ba. The General Profile: Concentrates on unique qualities of subject,\naspects of difference: what makes this person unique, different,\noutstanding, unusual, unconventional, nontraditional, nonstandard,\npeculiar, pale and\u00a0interesting?\n\u200bb. The Microcosm Profile: centers on aspects of sameness,\nuniversality.\nIn what ways is this person or this person\u2019s story typical, universal,\nhuman, like all of us? What part of her or her story can we all\nconnect\u00a0with?\n\u200bc. The News Profile: centers on the subject\u2019s connection to a news\nevent. Also could be called, as the Times does (or used to): Man in\nthe\nNews. Person in the\u00a0News?\n\nJonathan Maslow, June\u00a02004\n\n\nThe Enterprise\u00a0project\nIn our conference call with Cleveland Plain Dealer writer Connie\nSchultz, she mentioned several methods that helped her narrative series\n\u201cThe Burden of Innocence,\u201d which was the subject of our brown bag\nwriters group. They are excellent practices, not only for narrative\njournalism, but for any enterprise\u00a0story.\n\u200b1) Write as you go.\nSchultz said she always transcribed her notes as soon as possible and\nkept them in files organized by month as she worked on the series over\nthe course of one year. Any project that involves reporting over time\nbenefits from having well-organized notes from interviews and reporting.\nIt puts the writer ahead of the curve when you get down to the business\nof writing. This practice can be easily extended to the practice of\nwriting\nthemes, sections, scenes, dialogue, good quotes, etc. as you go. Don\u2019t\nimagine you can wait until you\u2019re reporting is done, then look back at\nyour notebooks or journal and suddenly pull the white rabbit out of the\nhat. Doesn\u2019t work like\u00a0that.\n\u200b2) Writing a Map/ outline.\nSchultz said that before she started to write, her editor asked for a\nwritten map, a term she described as having less onerous associations\nthan outline. The map or outline provides writer and editor with a guide\nto the story, where it starts, where it goes, what it\u2019s about, where it\nends. It makes the writer think. It need not be followed like a\ncontract. Whatever it\u2019s called, this best practice is one of the\nquintessential building blocks of longer-length writing. Without it, you\nare, effectively, roaming around blindfolded, hoping to pin the tail on\nthe donkey. With a roadmap or outline, even if rudimentary (many are the\noutlines noted on the back of a cocktail napkin; Tolstoy outlined Anna\nKarenina on a railroad train dining car menu (which, however, later fell\nbehind the sofa at his estate Yasnaya Polyana, forcing him to write War\n& Peace first instead, but that is another story)).you can focus on the\nmaterial and how to express it accurately, faily and gracefully, not on\nwhat to write\u00a0next.\n\u200b3) Rewriting.\nSchultz said rewriting was the most painful part\u2014 she went through a\ndozen major drafts. But rewriting is an absolutely necessary practice to\nachieve successful narratives/enterprise stories. If you are to become a\nskilled pro writer, you must get past the idea that rewriting means you\nare doing something wrong. Rewriting is, in fact, doing something right:\nImproving the story, draft by draft. No story has ever suffered from\nrewriting. Many suffered from too little rewriting. Just as the\nmap/outline helps the writer through the first draft, the editor\u2019s read\nand conferencing helps the writer through rewrite. Talk out what needs\nto be done. Partner. Writers don\u2019t need to accept everything an editor\nsays, like medicine or punishment. Writers do need to defend and\narticulate something they want to keep. Develop a collaborative rewrite\nstrategy and get to\u00a0it.\n\u200b4) Writing buddies.\nScultz said she chooses another writer in the newsroom she respects to\ncritique her pieces, so that she has an additional sounding board\noutside the editors-reporter loop. Practically every mature writer does\nthis, asking colleagues or friends to read the work and tell the brutal\ntruth. However, this practice really depends on choosing someone with\ngood judgment, analytical skill and the ability to articulate and\ncriticize> constructively. Anything less is less than\u00a0helpful.\n\nJonathan Maslow, April\u00a02003\n\n\nEdit Proof\u00a0copy\n\u200b1. The reporter\u2019s constant focus should be on the question: what is\nthis story about? That helps shape the lede, the angle, the structure,\neverything. Also, editors should keep reporters focused on this question\nthroughout the day so that the reporter refines and hones the story to\npresent the reader with a tight, concise, well-organized story without\nholes, digressions or\u00a0frills.\n\u200b2. There\u2019s a natural contradiction between the creative process and\ncritical thinking, between writer or storyteller inside us and the\neditor or\ncritic inside. The critic suppresses the storyteller and makes it\nharder for\nthe storyteller to tell the story. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to write a\nsolid\nlede: every time the storyteller wants to put a thought down, the\ncritic\nsays ,\u201dthat stinks,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s not good enough.\u201d So Chip Scanlon talked\nabout \u201clowering your standards\u201d when you draft your story. I think a\nbetter way to say this is to suspend your critical faculties while you\nare writing your first draft and just get it down using your creative\njuices. Then switch over to your critical faculties to rewrite, sharpen,\ntrim,\u00a0etc.\n\u200b3. A topic is not a story. You can\u2019t write about AIDS, or mass\ntransit, or affordable housing. Those are topics. A story has to have a\nbeginning, middle and end. It has to have characters. It has to have a\nplot.\nIt has to have a setting. This is a cogent point. How many times do\neditors hear from reporters, \u201cI want to write about poverty in\nPaterson.\u201d \u201cI want to write about the Passaic River.\u201d \u201cI want to write\nabout race relations between latinos and blacks.\u201d How many times do\nreporters hear from editors: \u201cWe should do a story about high property\ntaxes.\u201d Well what about it? Themes are not stories. Think about telling\nstories. It\u2019s\u00a0elemental.\n\u200b4. Words of wisdom from Don Murray, a legendary writing coach, on\norganizing and \u201cmapping\u201d the reporting and writing of a story:\nexplore, focus, rehearse, draft, clarify.\n\u200b5. Experienced reporters know what is the least amount of reporting\nthey need to do for any given story. Great reporters know there is no\nlimit\nexcept deadline for reporting, and that the quality of a story really,\ntruly\ndepends on the reporting, not the writing. If you don\u2019t know as many\nfacts\nand factoids as you possibly can, the story is going to be thin and\npale.\nSomebody said, \u201cReporting is taking a beer keg information and\nsqueezing it into a perfume\u00a0bottle.\n\u200b6. A good way to start the process: reporter and editor brainstorm\non reader\u2019s questions. What does the reader need to and want to know\nabout the story. That helps the reporter focuse on question above: What\nis this story\u00a0about?\n\u200b7. Rick Bragg\u2019s five boxes. NY Times reporter Rick Bragg learned\nfrom a mentor that he should organize and write his stories as if he\nhad\nfive empty boxes floating in the air above him: In the first box, he\nput the\nlede or grabber.

He is incredibly knowledgeable\nabout local and school budgets in New Jersey and has been very generous\nwith his\u00a0time.\n\nBudgets are made up of two main sections, revenues (income) and\nappropriations (spending). In an ideal world, these two would match\u00a0up.\n\n\nRevenues\\                                            Appropriations\n  Property taxes\\                                          Current expenses (salaries and other expenses)\n  State & Federal aid (fluctuates and may not come)\\       Capital outlay (big ticket repairs)\n  Miscellaneous revenues (fees, licenses, court costs)\\    Debt service (payment on municipal loans)\n   Surplus (carried over from last\u00a0year)                   \n\nAs Claude is fond of saying, municipal financing New Jersey is \u201cbuilt\nfor idiots.\u201d You have to \u201cappropriate\u201d the public dollar to use it for a\nspecific purpose. The governing body must vote to do this to pay any and\nall bills. Capital outlay is defined as durable goods that last more\nthan three\u00a0years.\nYour job, as a reporter, is to give readers an idea of how their taxes\nare going to go up and explain\u00a0why.\nThe total property tax bill is made up of several components:\nmunicipal services\nschools\ncounty\nopen space tax\nregional district tax\nfire\ngarbage\nLength of service annuity\u00a0program\nThe Length of Service annuity is meant to help support volunteer\nfirefighters and ambulance corps. Each town will pay for a volunteer\u2019s\nequipment, and this money must cover that. One-penny on the tax rate\ngoes to the annuities to be paid to a volunteer upon\u00a0retirement.\nNew Jersey also ran out of landfill space 20 years ago, so it must pay\nastronomical amounts to handle its\u00a0garbage.\nRegional districts are shared and provide rural schools that cover\nseveral towns. The towns that \u201csend\u201d their students to school in another\ntown must pay for those\u00a0services.\nYou have to tell your readers that the municipal services tax is going\nup, not just that taxes as a whole are\u00a0rising.\nThe state overseer of all issues regarding local finance is the\nDivision of Local Government Services under the Department of\nCommunity Affairs. In many ways, it functions like a state version of\nthe GAO.\nThe LGS reviews every municipal budget and must approve\u00a0it.\nThe council does not \u201cpass\u201d a budget. It first \u201cintroduces\u201d it to the\ntown\u2019s residents. Once the council introduces a budget, you as a\nreporter must be allowed to get a copy. They cannot give you a summary\nversion. The council will then go on to \u201cadopt\u201d the budget. A governing\nbody in New Jersey must have a two-thirds majority to pass a spending\u00a0matter.\nThe impact in dollars and\u00a0sense\nThe amount of your property taxes is based on the value of one-penny per\n\\$100 of the taxable value of your property. Each town hires an\nindependent assessment firm every few years to perform a \u201crevaluation\u201d\nof its properties. On that, it bases its property tax\u00a0assessments.\nThe tax rate is based on how much money your town collected last year.\nIf you only collected 95 percent of the taxes last year, you can collect\n105 percent this\u00a0year.\nThat extra 5 percent, if you can collect it, is set aside as a \u201creserve\nfor uncollected taxes\u201d. If this year you collect 98 percent of your\ntaxes, that extra 2 percent goes into your surplus and reserve. The\nreserve is anything you didn\u2019t spend last\u00a0year.\nThe surplus in the current budget comes out of last year\u2019s reserve.\nTowns will often underestimate their expected tax collection rate, or\noverestimate their appropriations so that at the end of the fiscal year,\nthey will have money left over to build their surplus. A surplus should\nbe between 3 and 5 percent of the total budget. You need to be able to\ncommunicate to your readers this pull-and-tug of making the revenues and\nappropriations match\u00a0up.\nYou need to know how many tax dollars come into your town if you collect\none penny per \\$100 of assessed\u00a0valuation.\nFirst, call your town\u2019s tax assessor and ask for the total valuation of\nyour town. You can also find it on the LGS\u2019 Web site here. If the\ntotal value of your town is \\$3 billion, one tax point will raise\n\\$300,000. So for every \\$300,000 in spending the city plans, it will\nlevy one point in\u00a0taxes.\nTo apply that to the average reader, multiply the tax-point times the\naverage assessed value of a property in your town. Again, you can find\nthis out from your tax assessor (who really should become your best\nfriend), or from the\u00a0LGS.\nSo if the average property in your town is worth \\$100,000, and your\ncouncil wants to buy a \\$1.2 million jet for the mayor, how much will\nthat cost your average\u00a0taxpayer?\nTo find the average tax rate for each person: Divide \\$100,000 by \\$100\nand then by 100 pennies. That gives you \\$10. So for each tax point that\nthe town raises its taxes, the average homeowner will pay \\$10 more. If\nthe municipality pays for the entire \\$1.2 million jet, that will cost 4\ntax points (\\$1.2 million divided by \\$300,000 per tax point). That will\ncost your average taxpayer \\$40 more each year (4 tax points times \\$10\nper point for the average\u00a0home).\nFiguring this out can help you paint spending decisions in a way readers\ncan grasp. You should have these base figures\u2014the total valuation, the\ntax point and the average value of a home\u2014handy for each of your\u00a0towns.\nSchool districts also receive state aid based on a formula. The state\nexpects each district to pay \\$10,000 each year to educate each student.\nThe state looks at the average income and property values of each town\nto see how much it can afford of that \\$10,000 per student. If it\ndoesn\u2019t have the money, the state will pay for the essentials. But arts\nand other programs, such as music, can not receive this \u201cstate\nequalization aid\u201d from\u00a0Trenton.\nThese budgets can be very confusing, but as a reporter, you need to\nlearn as much as you can about how they work. You must be able to talk\nshop with elected officials about the budgets to be able to detect\nattempts at slipping items through without the public\u2019s\u00a0notice.\n\nBy Tom\nWhen we\u2019re writing budget stories, local officials often omit key\nnumbers that every reader wants to know. To help ensure that you don\u2019t\nforget to press them to fill in the blanks, here\u2019s a handy checklist of\nthe key figures you need to ask for. Every budget story must include\nthis\u00a0graf:\n\n\nUnder the adopted (proposed) 2010 budget, the owner of a home\nassessed at the borough average of \\$65,000 will pay \\$2,395 in\nmunicipal (school/county) taxes, a rise of \\$99.70 from last year or\n4.4\u00a0percent.\n\nRemember:\n1. The fiscal year\n2. The average home assessment\n3. The total amount of that average municipal/school/county tax bill\n4. The total dollar increase in the average tax bill\n5.

            "text": "After yesterday\u2019s discussion, some might ask the obvious question:\naren\u2019t there already people doing\u00a0this?\nI don\u2019t intend to denigrate the years of service by so many passionate\nand intelligent fans. I wish they could have been compensated even a\nfraction for the sweat they\u2019ve poured into writing about the\u00a0game.\nAnd with varying degrees of success,\u00a0some organizations are attempting\nwhat I propose, to support legions of writers with the values and\nresources of their ancestors in newsprint. There\u2019s a battalion, at\nleast, of\u00a0podcasters.\u00a0There are networks of soccer scribes\nlike\u00a0American-Soccer-News.com. And then\u00a0there\u2019s\u00a0MLSsoccer.com.\nThere has been a little debate about whether fans should consider\nMLSsoccer.com to be a legitimate and credible news outlet. Forget for a\nmoment that no other major organizations provide comprehensive reporting\non the domestic leagues (even though one would expect that ESPN or\nFox Soccer would want to mount such an effort) and that MLS is\nsimply stepping into the breach to give fans what they want. \u00a0With the\nsweeping inhouse relaunch of the site this season, the league and its\nemployees\u00a0clearly\u00a0plan to \u201ccover\u201d the sport, both here and abroad. But\nshould they, and if not, what role should the league\u2019s official website\u00a0play?\n\n\n  Photo by Diego Radzinschi\n\n\nWe need to remind ourselves that MLSsoccer.com is the public relations\narm of a major corporation.\u00a0Many fans would agree that we really can\u2019t\ntrust the site to give us honest, straightforward reportage on issues\nthat are less than flattering to the league as a whole. As other writers\n(including [one at the U.S. Mens National Team Players Association\u2019s\nofficial website][]) have observed, it\u2019s like watching a snake eat its\nown tail when you try to get information from an official mouthpiece\nthat also attempts to cover the news.\u00a0You don\u2019t rely on the Federal\nReserve for unbiased, critical and important writing about U.S. monetary\npolicy. You don\u2019t need to do it with your favorite sport\u00a0either.\nMLSsoccer.com ought to be a repository of fast, easy-to-find video and\n(I credit this concept entirely to FakeSigi) openly accessible\nstatistical data. The site should create a public API to allow fans to\nuse the league\u2019s entire database of historical game and player\nstatistics. One can imagine how a blog like\u00a0Climbing the Ladder,\nwhich I believe does its analysis with its own cobbled-together data,\ncould be even cooler if it had the actual league stats to tinker\u00a0with.\nAlthough MLSsoccer.com is keeping more than a few people gainfully\nemployed, I want to see more organizations spring up so that so many\nwriters aren\u2019t directly dependent on the league to make a living. We\nneed to find ways to support good, young soccer writers so they can\nwork, report and get better at their craft without having to shill for\u00a0MLS.\nUnravel the conflicting\u00a0interests\nOutside MLSsoccer.com, much of the writing on the U.S. game resembles\nthe pamphleteering of the early Republic. Lots of Whigs and Federalists\nwrite blogs for like-minded folks, but their own biases can make them\nhard to take\u00a0seriously.\nAlthough some good coverage of the sport comes from partisans, I don\u2019t\nwant the writer on whom I rely to be staked in the camp of any one team.\nThere shouldn\u2019t be any fans in the press box. Stories and podcasts about\ngames shouldn\u2019t include the word \u201cwe.\u201d Soccer fans are incredibly\npassionate, and they go to great lengths to identify with their teams.\nBut I want knowledgeable, independent writers, free of the auspices of\nthe league and its card-carrying supporters\u00a0clubs.\nTo this end, I\u2019d like to see American soccer writers, professional and\namateur, adopt the ethical guidelines of the Associated Press Sports\nEditors. As an organization, the North American Soccer Reporters\nshould publicly lean on its members, particularly those not affiliated\nwith news agencies with their own ethics policies, to subscribe to this\ncode. It reads, in\u00a0part:\n\nEditors and reporters should avoid taking part in outside activities\nor employment that might create conflict of interest or even\nappearance of a\u00a0conflict.\n\nThey should not serve as an official scorer at baseball\u00a0games.\nThey should not write for team or league media guides or other\n    team or league publications. This has the potential of\n    compromising a reporter\u2019s disinterested\u00a0observations.\n\n\nAs fans, we pay to support soccer in this country, whether in satellite\npackages or scarves. If for no other reason than we want to make sure\nthat our money is well spent, we should expect the people who deliver\nthe news to be minding the bank rather than boosting their club.\u00a0The\nonly hitch: we may have to pay more to get what we\u00a0deserve.\nNo more free\u00a0transfers\nAt the very least, we need more neutral, unaffiliated writers who embody\nthe traditional values of newspaper journalism. In an ideal world, that\nwould come with a major investment to create a news organization that\ncould do justice to soccer\u2019s huge potential in this\u00a0country.\nSo far, there have been a handful of single proprietors who have been\nsuccessful at making a living on the internet as soccer hacks, most\nnotably my former Herald News colleague Ives Galarcep. But I\u2019m\nproposing an online publication that would require the footprint and\nresources of a larger organization to make it\u00a0work.\nThere are several\u2014largely untested\u2014business models that, with the\nright editorial direction and an angel investor or two, could produce\nsoccer news worth paying for. Not everything needs to be locked behind a\npay wall. Until relatively recently, Soccer America did just that, a\nprint-focused decision that could be argued largely blunted its\ninfluence as the demand for soccer news on the web exploded. I\u2019m not\nadvocating for any particular model, whether its based on subscriptions,\nsyndication, micropayments or the like. But readers need to understand\nthat you can really only get the stories you want when a publication can\npay for the work it takes to dig them\u00a0up.\nEarly in my career, I wrote about the Kansas City Wizards for Cyber\nSoccer Associates, a group that still exists and now maintains the\nAmerican Soccer News site. For two seasons,\nI followed the team, writing game previews and match reports. I hesitate\nto say I \u201ccovered\u201d the Wizards. As a part-time writer, I didn\u2019t have the\ntime to attend training sessions, and I really had no idea what I was\ndoing. I didn\u2019t develop stories or break news. I mostly reacted and\ntranscribed game events. It was a great gig, but in retrospect I see the\nmissed opportunities to go deeper. The model of American Soccer News,\nand I believe The Offside as well, is to create a network of\nvolunteer writers dedicated to individual teams and link them all under\none banner. It\u2019s a great idea, but it falls short in a couple of key\naspects: it\u2019s a part-time gig at best, and there\u2019s a tendency for the\nwriters to be advocates for the teams rather than probing\u00a0journalists.\nThis all leads me once more to a key question, as Richard Whittall\nhas asked time and\u00a0again:\n\nDon\u2019t most soccer bloggers secretly consider a career writing for a\nmajor news organization with all its resources, access, accreditation\nand living-ish wages, the ultimate endgame for their online\u00a0endeavours?\n\u2026Is this after all just a fun little hobby? And if not, what are we\nall going to do about it? Are traditional pay-for-content models\nreally and truly\u00a0dead?\n\nThe newspaper industry has largely ignored soccer, but the values of the\ndaily print journalist are hard to beat. And the truly good newspaper\nreporter is impossible to replace for free. With all the writers\nslogging away at this subject, we have the raw talent. We have the\nknowledge. We have a market for the news. The soccer fan should be an\nadvertiser\u2019s dream demographic. We need the business acumen that can\nmonetize the news so that writers can make the jump from dedicated and\nsometimes gifted amateurs to professional reporters, with all the\naccountability and responsibility that\u00a0entails.\nThere are two things on which American soccer fans can generally agree.\nWe want thriving, world-class domestic leagues, for both men and women,\nand we want the men\u2019s national team to win the World Cup. At this point,\nwe\u2019re decades, if not generations away from realizing those dreams. But\nwe can get there by taking one step at a time, and the most important\nstep is to keep the sport alive here long enough for it to\u00a0happen.\nA vigorous press, despite its shortcomings, has always been vital for a\nstrong democracy. For soccer to continue to grow in America, we need a\nstronger, independent press. To do it right, to have professional\nreporters competing to break stories in every city with a team, it will\ncost money. For soccer fans and other interested readers, it may be end\nup being cheap, but it won\u2019t be free. At the end of the day, for the\nsport we all love, it will be a small price to\u00a0pay.\nLeave a comment below or follow me on Twitter@ultracasualand\ntell me what you\u00a0think.\n[one at the U.S. Mens National Team Players Association\u2019s official\n  website]:\u00a0http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/ussoccerplayers/2010/04/mlssoccers-competitive-balance.html",

But over the\nlast 15 years, I\u2019ve driven myself crazy trying to find news about the\nprofessional game in all its domestic incarnations, whether it be Major\nLeague Soccer, Women\u2019s Professional Soccer or one of the lower\ndivisions.\nI make my living editing local news\u2014town councils, zoning boards,\nschool boards\u2014for a daily newspaper. It\u2019s been doubly frustrating for\nme then that a large majority of my colleagues in the media consider\nsoccer to be a third-class\u00a0sport.\nBy and large, soccer is ignored or, at best, squirreled away among the\nagate results, somewhere behind junior high water polo.\u00a0Much has been\nwritten in the blogosphere about how soccer is a sport\u00a0tailor-made for\nthe internet. With the advent over the past couple of years of\nprevalent, cheap and quick streaming video, anyone can now watch live\ngames from around the world. You don\u2019t need broadcasters to watch the\ngame. And you don\u2019t need your major metropolitan daily newspaper to read\nabout\u00a0it.\nFrustrated by the willful ignorance of newspapers and TV, soccer fans\nlike me have created their own media. Blogs, webzines, podcasts and\nother online publications have proliferated, sustained by fans who\nweren\u2019t getting the news and analysis they wanted. In many ways,\nAmerican fans have provided a perfect example of the \u201ccitizen\njournalism\u201d movement that\u00a0Jeff Jarvis has been preaching about all\nthese\u00a0years.\nIt\u2019s been great to see the level of engagement by so many regular fans,\nbut I still find myself yearning for more.

But there are so few opportunities to make\u00a0a living\nat soccer writing, it\u2019s difficult to expect anyone to answer the\nSiren call as anything more than a\u00a0hobby.\nThe problem begins with the big mainstream purveyors of sports\njournalism, the newspapers and magazines that have traditionally funded\nserious and ongoing reporting. They won\u2019t, for the most part, touch\nsoccer. Sure, we\u2019ll see a few features between now and\u00a0July 11, but\nthat\u2019s about it. At many publications, if they even have a soccer\nwriter, he or she is pretty far down in the newsroom pecking order.\nThey\u2019re lucky if their stories get any kind of play on the cover of the\nsports section at\u00a0all.\nFine. We\u2019ve spent the better part of two decades whining about this.\nSoccer speaks for itself. The market for the game is growing and will\ncontinue to expand for some time to come. As\u00a0Richard Whittall\ncorrectly\u00a0observes:\n\nAnd as large, ungainly media outlets are forced to cut costs and\nbroaden content, in-depth sports journalism will be left to a sea of\nindependent, often fan-biased bloggers working with their own\nresources. Many club supporters will be smarter, more connected, and\nmore knowledgeable as information about club and league power\nstructures are exposed to an increasingly-global fan\u00a0base.\n\nThe vibrant and growing community of writers that has evolved online has\nbeen a great (if only partial) antidote. In some ways, this grassroots\njournalism resembles the punk rock and Jamaican music scenes of the \u201860s\nand \u201870s. If you don\u2019t find what you want, do it yourself. This attitude\nhas served soccer well at a time when the internet enables anyone with\nthe chutzpah to pretend to be an expert and the free time to devote to\nit to become a soccer pundit with hundreds, if not thousands of\nfollowers. The laptop and Wordpress are the three chords of the internet\nrevolution. Anyone can do it, and when the \u201cprofessionals\u201d won\u2019t, anyone\u00a0will.\nThe super\u00a0subs\nAs I researched this piece, I kept finding (or being reminded of) more\nand more examples of very nice work being done by amateurs, bloggers and\nprofessionals\u00a0alike.\nThere\u2019s The Run of Play, whose ether binge cultural criticism is\nnothing if not fascinating (not to mention its design, which is truly\nunique in this genre). There\u2019s the pseudonymous Fake Sigi (a Fake Steve\nJobs aimed at those who follow one of Major League Soccer\u2019s most\nsuccessful and rotund coaches, Sigi Schmid), whose\u00a0scathing dissection\nand analysis of the league-run mouthpiece, MLSsoccer.com, has been a\nreal revelation in recent\u00a0months.\nThen there\u2019s the fan-oriented networks of bloggers and podcasters who\nspend countless hours watching, breaking down and reviewing matches.\nMany of them conduct interviews with players, coaches and officials as\nwell as journalists and fellow fans.\u00a0Seeing Red, a relatively new\npodcast covering the New York Red Bulls, has been a valuable addition\nthis season to the coverage of the team from the fan\u2019s\u00a0seats.\n(In the spirit of full disclosure, over the past six years, I have\nedited a pair of soccer blogs, on my own and for my former newspaper.\nThose experiences, and their unceremonious ends, give me even more\nrespect for those who continue to slog away at the daily grind of\u00a0blogging.)\nAdd to these the traditional newspaper and magazine journalists who have\ntaken to the web and social networks to hone their brand and solidify\ntheir command of the beat:\u00a0Ives Galarcep,\u00a0Steve Goff,\u00a0Grant\nWahl,\u00a0Jack Bell and so\u00a0on.\nThere\u2019s a lot to like. Still, we can and should all expect a lot\u00a0more.\nUnderstandably, some bloggers and amateur reporters can adopt a\ndefensive posture on the subject of professionalism. It\u2019s not unique to\nsoccer writing, and it\u2019s certainly not unique to America. Although the\nissues are somewhat different in England,\u00a0Lukey Moore, one of the\nfanatics behind the hilarious, exceptional and smart\u00a0Football Ramble\npodcast, elucidated this view\u00a0in a recent interview:\n\nThere is a bit of a backlash in the media these days against things\nlike amateur blogs and podcasts, a lot of journalists think that the\ngeneral public\u2019s opinions are not as valid because they are not\n\u2018proper journalists\u2019. Doesn\u2019t really bother me though, I can count on\none hand the number of football journalists I actually\u00a0respect.\n\nThere\u2019s no argument that professional caliber journalists don\u2019t hold a\nmonopoly on opinions or incisive commentary. But in one important\nregard, they can\u2019t be beat. Few others have the time, patience or\nability to build relationships with sources in the game that can unlock\ndifficult stories. That kind of deep reporting can grant them the\nauthority to ask the unpopular questions that the powers-that-be would\nrather\u00a0ignore.\nThe need for\u00a0game-changers\nIn my little free time, I want to read something about soccer in North\nAmerica that: a) I didn\u2019t know already, b) casts a critical eye on the\nsport, and c) comes from someone who is a skeptical spectator,\ndisinterested in the outcome of any particular\u00a0game.\nThere are a few dozen solid reporters on the beat in this country, as\nthe roster of the\u00a0North American Soccer Reporters will attest. But\nthere aren\u2019t nearly\u00a0enough.\nNew York Times executive editor Bill Keller\u2019s\u00a0recent reviewof a\nbiography of Henry Luce captured a bit of my\u00a0quandary.\n\n\u2026a significant population of serious people feel the need for\nsomeone with training, experience and standards \u2014 reporters and\neditors \u2014 to help them dig up and sort through the news, identify\nwhat\u2019s important and make sense of it. That in no way precludes\nenlisting the audience as commentators, as contributors and as\ncollaborators. (Witness the splendid hybrid of professional and\namateur journalism that has kept alive the stream of news from\u00a0Iran.)\n\nSome days, it seems that 99 percent of soccer \u201cnews\u201d could be classified\nas either game transcripts or outright boosterism. I read quite a\nbit of it, but I also want the news that you can really only get by\nchasing it full time, building relationships with players, front office\nstaff, owners, league employees, coaches and referees over the\u00a0years.\nIn the jargon of my industry, I want more of the old media\u2019s values in\nthis new media sport: Accountability, speed, skepticism, fearless\nquestioning of authority. Get it fast and get it right, and when you\ndon\u2019t get it right, own up to your mistake and correct it. Without these\nkind of mores suffused into our writers, I worry that far too many\nimportant stories are crying out for more reporting. What happened to\nCharlie Davies on the night of his accident? What is going on with\nShalrie Joseph\u2019s life and career? What kind of negotiations went\ninto crafting Major League Soccer\u2019s latest labor\u00a0agreement?\nSometimes it seems there\u2019s a disconnect between soccer writing and news\njournalism. I go to work every day and ask questions of people in power\nbecause I act as a proxy for the regular, taxpaying resident. There is a\npresumption that government should be open and accountable. Regardless\nof how much we couch it in terms of passion, culture and tradition,\nsoccer is a business. It\u2019s becoming a very lucrative business, and it\u2019s\nvery closely held. It\u2019s a private enterprise, and thus there isn\u2019t that\nsame moral authority to ask questions and demand answers. But still,\nreporters should be using their access, knowledge and insight on behalf\nof the average\u00a0fan.\nSomeone needs to ask probing questions. We need reporters to help hold\nmanagers and clubs responsible for their mistakes, whether they be poor\ntactical decisions at a US Open Cup match or the financial mismanagement\nof an entire club (See: Portsmouth, Leeds, Crystal Palace, Chester City,\nLA Sol, Miami Fusion, etc). We\u2019re being sold a product, whether it\u2019s\nseason tickets or jerseys or television advertising. If we\u2019re going to\ninvest our money (not to mention time and energy), it should be worth\nour\u00a0investment.\n\n[Marie Hardin][], a professor at Penn State\u2019s [John Curley Center for\nSports Journalism][],\u00a0[wrote a piece][] in 2007 arguing for a stronger\nethical grounding for sports reporters:\n\n\n\nOne has to wonder what other stories in the public interest (about\nsystematic problems and corruption in sports, including those at the\nprep level) may have also gone unwritten. Although perceived as fun\nand games, sports at almost every level in the United States have\nbecome big business with consequences beyond the playing fields.\nSports journalists have an ethical obligation to provide citizens and\nconsumers with fair and balanced reporting on issues that affect their\ncommunities, their pocketbooks and the health and educations of their\u00a0children.\n\nHere in America, we need more reporters walking the soccer beat day in\nand day out, particularly in towns that aren\u2019t so sexy. We need more\npeople in Kansas City, St. Louis, Salt Lake City and Dallas, for\nexample. We need more people asking tough questions and competing with\nthe writers already out there. A competitor breathing down your neck\nreally helps you kick it into gear and get a better\u00a0story.\nBefore we get more writers (which I\u2019ll discuss in a second part\ntomorrow), we need to add the values of professional journalism to the\nhealthy and established internet community of writers. I\u2019m not\nadvocating for a new alliance of bloggers, each sitting in his own\napartment and riffing, linking back and forth. I\u2019m talking about a\nserious, concerted effort to groom, deploy and support soccer\u00a0writers.\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll discuss how the writers we have can get better and what\nwe\u2019ll need to do to get more of\u00a0them.\nLeave a comment below or follow me on Twitter@ultracasualand\ntell me what you\u00a0think.",

            "text": "A few months ago, I was laid up for a few days recovering from knee\nsurgery. I spent most of the time lounging on the sofa and watching\nEuropean soccer games on ESPN3.com. But I also stumbled upon a great\nseries of podcasts that walked me through how and why journalists\nshould\u00a0bushwhack\u00a0into the social media\u00a0frontier.\nThe programs, essentially a series of lo-fi internet radio call-in\nshows, were hosted by\u00a0Sree Sreenivasan, dean of student affairs at\nColumbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. Like everyone\nelse on the planet, I had been dabbling in Facebook, and I had heard\na lot about Twitter but didn\u2019t understand how to use either very well,\nparticularly as a\u00a0journalist.\nSo I charged through Sree\u2019s programs (mostly using Google\u2019s\nexcellent Listen app on my Android phone). The most helpful were the\nepisodes on Basic Twitter and Facebook for journalists. They\ngave some practical, but simple background on each service and shared\nadvice from other working professionals. It was enough to make me feel\ncomfortable\u00a0experimenting.\nThen I went to pick up more of the episodes, which covered\u00a0topics\nlike\u00a0launching your own media company, using Google Docs in\nreporting and what exactly are we supposed to do with LinkedIn?\nThe audio quality wasn\u2019t crystal clear, but the medium was simple and\nstraightforward. Before finding these, I was addicted to my RSS feeds,\nchecking each one religiously throughout the work day. I now can go\nthree or four days without even remembering to open Google\u00a0Reader.\nInstead, with Twitter I have this incredible, if sometimes overwhelming,\nstream of information coming at me in (often) clever, funny snippets.\nAnd with its open, collaborative nature, it\u2019s far more likely that I\u2019ll\nbe turned on to new, engaging news sources and writers than I ever would\nfind by reading hundreds of individual blogs. I\u2019ve found about a hundred\nwriters covering media issues, food, beer, film, television and soccer\nto follow on Twitter and to keep me abreast of the news and ideas of the\nday. Particularly for a news junkie, it\u2019s a great\u00a0advance.\nAs I\u2019ve gotten more comfortable with the service, I\u2019ve experimented with\na couple of Twitter management programs that help me more easily handle\nthe onslaught of information.\u00a0Seesmic has a half-decent app for\nAndroid phones, but I\u2019ve settled on using\u00a0Hootsuite (also on Sree\u2019s\nadvice). It\u2019s got a great web interface that allows you to manage not\nonly Twitter, but also LinkedIn, Facebook and Myspace accounts, and its\nAndroid app is easy and\u00a0attractive.\nIf you\u2019re curious about this whole Twitter phenomenon in particular, I\u2019d\nrecommend checking out Sree\u2019s podcasts and then peruse his\nexhaustive\u00a0Twitter guide for skeptics and newbies. If you decide to\nsign up (or if you\u2019re already there), let me know so that I can start\nfollowing your work\u00a0too.\nLeave a comment below or follow me on Twitter@ultracasualand\ntell me what tools you\u2019ve found useful in navigating the social\u00a0mediasphere.",

            "text": "Things have been pretty hectic over the last year. The Local News\nService is fully staffed and running at full steam. Over the summer, we\nhad a baby. Between the two, I\u2019ve had my hands\u00a0full.\nEarlier this week, I was invited to speak on a panel to address the\nfaculty at Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. It\ngave me the opportunity to reflect on LNS\u2019 first 10 months of operation\nand what I\u2019ve learned. Here\u2019s a draft of my scripted\u00a0remarks:\n\n\nWhat\u2019s changing, and what isn\u2019t, in newsrooms\u00a0today?\nLet me start first with a little bit of background, because I get a\nlot of questions about what the Local News Service is and how it\u2019s\nrelated to the\u00a0Star-Ledger.\nIn 2008, the Star-Ledger lost about 45 percent of its staff through a\nmassive buyout. Its parent company, Advance Publications, decided\nto set up a separate company to provide local news. This was not\nunprecedented. For years, the Ledger\u2019s high school sports and\nobituaries have been done by an outside outfit.\nLNS was launched last year to create a new cost structure and to\nfill the local pages of the Star-Ledger and its website,\nNJ.com.\nWe have a newsroom of 15 reporters and 3 photographers covering\nmunicipal, local and breaking news in the six core counties of the\nStar-Ledger\u2019s coverage area. Three experienced editors, including\nmyself and Rick Everett (retired Star-Ledger managing editor), offer\ndirection, context and\u00a0guidance.\nWe have an additional nine or 10 staffers who produce 26 listing\ncalendars a week as well as community news items, Scouting and schools\nnews and a history\u00a0column.\nOur purpose is to produce more content for print and online with\nfewer, less experienced journalists. At the same time, we want to\nmaintain the same quality and standards that readers expect of the\nstate\u2019s biggest newspaper. And we\u2019ve done just that. Our photographers\nand reporters produce a ton of copy. We have helped bolster the\nLedger\u2019s zoned county sections, and on occasion, we\u2019ve contributed\nstories to the features, business and sports sections. And while our\nprimary objective is local news, we\u2019ve also snagged 27 front page\nstories and probably twice as many Jersey section cover pieces since\nwe went live in\u00a0March.\nAlong the way, I\u2019ve observed a few\u00a0things:\nThe competition is changing. Our old enemies have become our new\nfriends as we join to fight new enemies. We now compete online with\ndozens of hyperlocal websites (Patch,\u00a0Baristanet, Maplewood\nOnline, The Local, etc) as well as our old print foes from the\nGannett papers. At the same time, the Ledger has largely buried the\nhatchet with its old rival the Bergen Record,\u00a0and they now share\nmost stories and have a combined statehouse bureau in\u00a0Trenton.\nEverything is faster. When we get a breaking news tip, we want to get\nit confirmed and get a short version of the story online immediately,\nif not sooner. The pace is picking\u00a0up.\nOur news gatherers are young. Only one of the 15 we hired was over 30.\nThis has resulted in the loss of some institutional memory. In many\ncases, the veterans who had been in the Ledger\u2019s county bureaus for\ndecades are gone. Some are now working as spokesmen for various state\nand local agencies and private companies. But they have been replaced,\nby and large, by ambitious and energetic reporters who know little to\nnothing about New Jersey and its stories. It has been a challenge for\nus to fill those gaps while our reporters cover, in some cases, 10 or\nmore\u00a0towns.\nAlthough our reporters are sophisticated Web consumers and are\ncomfortable with blogging, Facebook, shooting photos and even\nproducing videos, there is no replacement for basic reporting skills.\nThe most important thing I need from a new reporter is the ability to\nask questions and chase a story. It does me no good if you can make a\nsound slide or build a web page if you can\u2019t find a story, ask\nquestions and get it right. I\u2019ve also noticed that as great as it is,\nGoogle has almost grown too popular. I have a reporter who rather than\ncheck the Star-Ledger\u2019s own, comprehensive online archives when\nlooking for old clips, she will instead just Google it and see what\nhits come up from NJ.com. She doesn\u2019t even go to her own website to\nlook for\u00a0stories.\nAll this turmoil and change has been a very tough transition for\nreaders. Our sources, particularly our favorite gadflies and midlevel\nlocal bureaucrats, have found this very confusing. They had been used\nto, in many cases, dealing with the same reporters for a decade or\nmore. They knew who to call when there was news. Now they don\u2019t know\nwho covers what. We have gone to great lengths to get our name out\nthere. We\u2019ve sent our reporters to as many meetings and events as we\ncan in our towns to schmooze residents and officials and explain we\u2019re\na new operation and get our faces out\u00a0there.\nAll of this is, however, exciting. We have a great time doing what we\ndo. Our reporters, because they haven\u2019t been poisoned by the malaise\nthat afflicts many news organizations, really enjoy their jobs. We\nhave fun going into work every day and chasing the news. We get\nexcited when one of our people gets a front page\u00a0story.\nIn many ways, even as business models evolve, the work we do as\njournalists every day hasn\u2019t changed all that much. We have better\ntools to work with in some cases, and we\u2019ve got to do more, faster,\nbut at the end of the day, it\u2019s journalism. I couldn\u2019t be\u00a0happier.\n",

Police say the man shot three\npeople in their heads before he fled, killing his wife and another\nparishioner and critically injuring his wife\u2019s\u00a0cousin.\nIt was a sad story, and our coverage on that Sunday and in the\nsubsequent days revealed a small, tight-knit community of\nChristians here that is made up predominantly of immigrants from the\nsouthern Indian state of Kerala. (Unfortunately, the relaunch of our Web\nsite this week wiped out about six other stories we wrote)\n\nPretty quickly after the shootings, parishioners who were in the church\ngave our reporters the name of the man they thought was the shooter (and\nwho was arraigned in court today). I found his phone number in\nCalifornia, and we called it. The woman who answered the phone didn\u2019t\nspeak English, only malayalam, the language used in Kerala. I wondered\nhow I could find a translator on a Sunday\u00a0evening.\nThen I remembered that for the past four years I\u2019ve been a member of the\nSouth Asian Journalists Association or SAJA. I was ashamed I didn\u2019t\nthink of it sooner. So I sent an e-mail to another member looking for\nhelp. Within 15 minutes, I got a phone call from someone willing to do\nsome on-the-fly translation through a conference\u00a0call.\nWhen we called California again, perhaps unsurprisingly, no one\nanswered. But I was pleased by the help that SAJA was willing to offer.\nThen one of its members posted about our story on the group\u2019s South\nAsian issues blog, SAJAforum. The comments that the forum\u2019s readers\nleft in response to the story helped our staff members find new avenues\nof reporting in the following days. It was an indescribable\u00a0boon.\nI was truly impressed with the resources SAJA had assembled and the\ncollegiality and professionalism of its members as they offered advice\nand help with our story. I was sold on renewing my\u00a0membership.\nThen, a couple days later, the terrorist attacks in Mumbai happened.\nSince then, SAJA has gone into overdrive. SAJAforum has offered loads of\ntips, including daily podcasts and phonecasts. With its coverage of this\nevent, SAJAforum has proven itself an indispensable resource for anyone\nseriously covering South Asian news, both here and abroad. I can\u2019t\nrecommend it\u00a0enough.",

The students seem curious and eager to learn about working\nwith Excel and databases, even if it\u2019s not quite clear to them yet what\nto do with it all. I think this will be a good chance for me to practice\nmy classroom demeanor. And hopefully it\u2019ll give me the impetus to make\nsome more headway on fleshing out the Best Practices\u00a0section.\nWhat advice do you have for me as I strive to teach the next generation\nof journalists and\u00a0writers?\n",

It\u2019s a fascinating\nidea that the NY Times recently took a look at (thanks, Slashdot\nfor bringing it to my\u00a0attention).\nLet\u2019s set aside for a moment the daunting challenges of trying to make\nthis work in the real world. Why shouldn\u2019t news subjects have a chance\nto comment on a story in which they appear, particularly on the Web\nwhere the column inches are infinite? Certainly sources have already\ntaken advantage of the comment functions that many news organizations\u2019\nWeb sites already employ. But Google has hit upon a unique twist by\nweighting the comments from those quoted in a story. The journalist has\nalready gone to the effort of vetting sources and weeding out those with\nless substantial thoughts to add to a story. To give them a chance to\ncomment after the fact and append it to the story can only add to the\ndepth of the\u00a0coverage.\nIt\u2019s conceivable that you could give every source you interview a\nspecial URL and a password. Once the story appears in the paper, they\ncould then choose to login and sound off. It would assuage the bruised\negos of those long-winded subjects who inevitably lose much of their\nargument to brevity. It would also keep reporters on their toes that\nthey could expect more than a nasty letter to the editor should they\nplay fast and loose with the\u00a0facts.\nWhat do you think? Is there any reason we as journalists couldn\u2019t (or\nshouldn\u2019t) provide such a function on our own Web sites? Or should we\nlet Google have all the\u00a0fun?",

A silly bit of\ncarelessness can sully the credibility of the entire story.

But my latest project, which I put\ntogether in conjunction with our intrepid cops reporter, looks at the\nworst intersections in our county for\u00a0pedestrians.\nIt all started when I found that the New Jersey Department of\nTransportation posts all of its crash records\u2014the databases listing\nevery accident in the state in which a report was filed\u2014online. We took\na look at the last six years to see what intersections have proved most\ndangerous, and deadly, for walkers and cyclists. Once I got the data,\nthe hardest part was figuring out how to standardize the names of the\nintersections. One accident might be listed at Main and Market streets.\nThe next accident would be listed at Market and Main streets, but\nthey\u2019re really the same interesction. With a little help from the\neverready NICAR listserv, I leapt over that hurdle and kept\u00a0running.\nWe used the state DOT\u2019s formula for weighting the severity of each\naccident. Those with more serious injuries got a higher score. Those\nwith a complaint of pain or simply property damage got a very low score.\nThen we just added up the scores for every accident at each\nintersection. Pretty straightforward, although it took us some time to\npull it all\u00a0together.\nThe product, a nice explainer piece for our readers, ran Sunday. Judging\nby the early chatter on the local message boards, forums and blogs, it\nseemed to get a good response from readers. It was accompanied by a\ncoolsound slides that we put together with the help of our photo\nstaff. Of course, there was also the de rigeurGoogle map showing the\nclusters of the worst intersections and highlighting the 12 where\npedestrians have been killed by drivers since 2001.\n\nThen, this morning, we ran a project that I had coached and edited from\nthe beginning on the dogfighting underworld in New Jersey. Despite\nthe headlines generated by Michael Vick\u2019s arrest and downfall over the\nsummer, very few outlets really took the time to understand the allure\nof dogfighting and related blood sports like\u00a0cockfighting.\nReporter Heather Haddon spent weeks cultivating sources to do just that,\nto get into the dogfighting landscape that is surprisingly popular here\nand to explain why thousands of people are attracted to it. I think she\ndid a great job. I hope you\u00a0agree.\nLet me know what you think of these projects. Any reactions? Criticisms?\u00a0Advice?",

Since I don\u2019t have cable at home, and the\ngames have been broadcast in the middle of the night, I\u2019m sad to say I\nhaven\u2019t seen any of the play beyond the usual highlight clips on\u00a0YouTube.\nBut I have been very interested in the small bit of very good writing\nabout the tournament that has made its way back here. Steve Goff of the\nWashington Post made the trip to China to follow the U.S. Women\u2019s\nNational Team\u2019s exploits there, in the process offering a window into\nthe East that we rarely\u00a0get.\nThe stories that have captured my attention the most thus far are those\nthat show the inequities that exist in world football. Even though few\npeople really support the Americans here, they are the best team on the\nplanet (rivaled perhaps only by Germany and, now, Brazil). Other\nnations treat their women\u2019s teams the same way Americans treat all\nprofessional soccer\u2014like a second-class sport fit only for the Third\u00a0World.\nProbably the best story I\u2019ve seen on the growing pains of women\u2019s\nfootball around the globe illustrates that better than most. It came in\nthis excellent Al-Jazeera English piece on the slow rise of women\u2019s\nsoccer in Egypt (thanks to the\nlate-to-the-game-but-increasingly-greatGoal blogby the NY Times for\nthe clip). Perhaps it\u2019s unsurprising that no teams from the Middle East\nmade it to China for this year\u2019s\u00a0tournament.\nSo the U.S. Women will face off against the Brazilian Samba Queens\nThursday in the Cup\u2019s semi-finals. A win against Brazil (nearly\nunthinkable for the men\u2019s squad), and the team will book a slot in the\nfinals, likely against its nemesis Germany. I think there\u2019s really no\ndownside to the expanding popularity, and skill, of the women\u2019s game.\nBut as Steve Goff reported today the glass ceiling isn\u2019t just an\nobstacle for women in corporate America. The winners of the Women\u2019s\nWorld Cup will receive a mere fraction of the prize money that the\nItalian men took home last\u00a0summer.\nAs entertaining as the games in China may be, we\u2019ve still got a long way\nto\u00a0go.",

As this\nstory broke about 9 a.m. on a Thursday, I got to really sink my teeth\ninto managing this story. We deployed 11 of our 13 city desk reporters\nto cover the news. Then we wrangled another three reporters from the\nfeatures desk to lend a\u00a0hand.\nWe put out a barrage of stories in Friday\u2019s paper: from the reaction of\nthe constituents to the immediate political wrangling that\nerupted over the pending election for the seat of the\nAssemblyman/Undersheriff/Clergyman who\nwas arrested. We also had a nice profile of the former professional\nwrestler and cop-turned-mayor who got caught in the sting. Our lead\npiece used some of the text from the federal complaints and wiretaps to\nanalyze the differing leadership styles of the two arrested\nheavyweights from our\u00a0area.\nAnd then at 3 p.m. on the same day, they shut down the entire school\nsystem in the city of Paterson for fire code violations. So we had\nto scramble two more reporters to handle that\u00a0story.\nIt was a great rush to work on a big breaking story from the other side\nof the assigning desk, moving reporters and resources around to handle\nthe emerging threads of the news. I got to chip in by doing some\nbackgrounding of some of the arrested pols, but I didn\u2019t get to be as\nhands-on as I normally would. Thankfully, there will surely be more\nstories like this coming down the\u00a0road.\nAnd three days later, while working a weekend shift as a humble\nreporter, I finally got my shot to write a piece of the story.\nSo it\u00a0goes.",

Salinger) on my early life as a\u00a0writer.\nBut the hustle and bustle of daily journalism has once again thwarted my\nbest\u00a0intentions.\n50 years ago today, Kerouac\u2019s \u201cOn the Road\u201d was published. Reading\nit as a teenager\u2014if only I could remember who had first handed me a\ncopy\u2014led me on an odyssey of discovering and devouring the subversive,\nonomatopoetic oevre of the Beat Generation and its writers. Since\nthen, many others have surmounted Kerouac\u2019s primacy in my pantheon of\nliterary gods, but I still hold a soft spot for him (and the dozens of\neditions of his books I still\u00a0hoard).\n\n\nMy desire to mimic Kerouac, and his brief stint as a sports reporter,\nled me to explore journalism as a\u00a0career.\nThen, my high school English teacher, with his heavy Southern accent and\naffinity for heavy suede workboots, spied me reading \u201cOn the Road\u201d\nbefore class (it was not on the\u00a0syllabus).\n\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d he said, \u201cOl\u2019 Jack drank hi\u2019self to death back in\u00a0\u201869.\u201d\nThat teacher turned me on to H.L. Mencken and taught me to write a news\u00a0story.\nA couple weeks ago, I rode my bicycle through Brooklyn and Queens to\nvisit Kerouac\u2019s former apartment in Ozone Park. Over what is now a\nflower shop (\u201cLittle Shoppe of Flowers\u201d\u2026hilarious), he lived with his\nparents and wrote \u201cThe Town and the City\u201d. I believe it was also the\napartment where his father died of stomach cancer, exacerbated by his\ndrinking. On a busy morning, I rode through traffic on Crossbay\nBoulevard to visit the site. A man washed his ambulance on the street\noutside. He looked at me like I was crazy for taking a picture of the\nbuilding and the small plaque next to the\u00a0door:\n\nSo now, let me join the chorus of writers who have come to\npraise Kerouac and to bury him. Maybe it\u2019s time I picked up \u201cVanity\nof Duluoz\u201d or \u201cMaggie Cassidy\u201d one more time. It\u2019s funny, the\nplaces these circuitous trails lead\u00a0you.",

I had actually been planning on\nposting this for the last few days, when I noticed this mention the\nAnalytic Journalism blog of Google\u2019s new feature that allows users to\nembed a personal Google Map into a Web blog using just a tiny snippet of\nHTML. This is a feature that\u2019s long overdue, and should make all of the\nhub-bub over map mash-ups all the more accessible for the average\u00a0user.\nI almost wish they had offered such a feature last year when I made my\nfirst Google Map. I was writing an investigative project about the\ncity of Paterson selling off its property tax liens against vacant lots\nto a third-party investor. I decided to take the database I had already\nbuilt, and with a little help from Excel, I was able to add the lines of\ncode that let me dump it into a map using the Google Maps API.\nWithout ever having worked with an API in my life\u2014just a little bit of\nrudimentary HTML\u2014I was able to learn the code and whip up the map in\nthe span of a couple days. Most of that time was spent on the hardest\npart: driving around town with a laptop on my passenger\u2019s seat and a\nphotographer in the back taking pictures of each of the 160+ properties\non the map. I thought it came out\u00a0great.\nAdding a Google Map to your story (or a Yahoo Map for that matter) is\nconsiderably easier than working with ArcGIS to produce the static maps\nyou often see in the paper. And its a great Web feature that readers\nseem to dig. If you want to learn how to start tinkering with the API,\nhere\u2019s a few good starter\u00a0pages:\n\nGoogle Maps API\u00a0tutorial\nMapki: a Google Maps\u00a0wiki\nThe Google Maps Mania\u00a0blog\nA Google Maps geocoder (which you need to determine the\n    longitude and latitude points for the addresses you want to plot on\n    a\u00a0map.\nThe Donkey Magic mapmaker will help you create your map using\n    next to no code. It writes the backend source code and you just cut\n    and\u00a0paste.\n\nAlso, here\u2019s a few other of my favorite recent mapping\u00a0toys:\n\nThe Gmap Pedometer helps you find routes (and distances between\n    destinations) as the crow walks, block by block. This is great for\n    living in New York City. I use it to plot out [my weekly bike\n    rides][] across the Outer\u00a0Boroughs.\nFinally, BatchGeocode.com is a great resource that I seem to use\n    again and again for mapping projects large and small. If you have a\n    lot of points (more than a few hundred), it can take some time, but\n    it\u2019s free and it\u2019s easy, like all good maps (and graphics in\n    general) should\u00a0be.\n",

I thought that people might not be able to\ncomprehend the suffering of the poor that natural disasters could only\u00a0compound.\nAnd when, on assignment, I choked on pepper spray as I stood among\nprotesters being arrested, taking notes at a presidential inauguration,\nI worried that I wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe\u00a0again.\nBut each of these times, and every day before and since, I reminded\nmyself that if I do not write these stories, no one else will. My job is\nto shine a light on the lives of working Americans. Without these\nstories, our understanding of modern life is not only incomplete, it\u2019s\u00a0inaccurate.\nThe quest to tell these stories began for me at 18, when I moved from my\nhometown of Baltimore to the Midwest. I began to dive into the lives of\nthe working-class and the forgotten Americans that I would later\nchronicle in my work. Even while I studied at, and\neventually was graduated from, the world\u2019s first journalism school at\nthe University of Missouri, I longed to write their\u00a0stories.\nSince then, I have worked for several newspapers and a wire service. But\nI also worked in a hodgepodge of fields that have reminded me of the\ngreater world, a world outside the halls of government and police\nstations where we as journalists often find ourselves stuck. I have been\na welder, a construction laborer, a deli worker, a short-order cook, a\nDJ, a dishwasher, a record store clerk, a grocery store bagger and a\u00a0closed-captioner.\nAlong the way, I moved to New York City where I completed my Master\u2019s\ndegree at the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia\u00a0University.\nToday, I live in Brooklyn with my wife, her very fat cat and our very\nold dog. I am the research reporter\u2014responsible for computer-assisted\nreporting and freedom of information requests\u2014for the daily Herald\nNews, about 20 miles away in New Jersey. My job allows me to pursue\nthe kind of journalism I\u2019ve always wanted to do. I get to write\nstories\u2014about corruption, about poverty, about working, about floods\nand protests\u2014that people need to read. I get to write stories that show\nour readers a world they never knew existed or, worse yet, never\u00a0understood.\nIn what little free time I have, I am also researching a book that I\nbegan while a student in Samuel Freedman\u2019s renowned book-writing\nseminar.\nI\u2019m very glad you stumbled upon this Web site. I hope you\u2019re looking for\nthe kind of stories that I like to write, stories about people who never\nget recognized. Now you\u2019ll know to watch for my byline.
